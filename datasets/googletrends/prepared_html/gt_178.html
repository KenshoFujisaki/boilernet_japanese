          The bright pink beverage, which starts off tasting sweet, then segues to sour, is available only through Sunday. It's what people in the business call stunt food: an unusual dish or drink â€”Â based on taste, size or ingredients â€”Â created for a limited time to grab attention.

          Whether these gimmicks haveÂ the power to boost a company's bottom line is debatable. What is clear, though, is that these promotions tap into people's need to beÂ trendy, taste different thingsÂ and share wacky images on social media.

          "Whether itâ€™s the Unicorn Frappuccino or whatever's coming in two weeks at a burger place, consumers know more about food now than they ever have before," explained Couvelier. "Food is today's hottest social currency."

          And the need for food is never-ending, which is why shoppers see way-out-there creativity on menus that they don't see on, say, furniture showroom floors or on car dashboards. Three times a day, plus at regular snacking and drinking intervals, their hungerÂ is up for grabs.

          Morningstar restaurant analystÂ R.J. Hottovy doesn't think the Unicorn Frappuccino will affectÂ sales and quarterly earnings, but sees the drink as a way for the Seattle-based coffee chain to create buzz, which is valuable in itself.

         <span __boilernet_label="1" __num="22">
          "You won't see it move the needle," he said. "Itâ€™s a competitiveÂ market. A lot of people are moving into the coffee space. It's not for everyone, but it gets people talking."

          Peter Saleh, managing director and restaurant analyst at BTIG, disagreed, and pointed out that the chain has focused for years on creating drinks, and the level of chatter that this oneÂ has stirred could make it even more significant than others.

          That could be enough to lureÂ people with zero interest in new drinks into a Starbucks. And those who are intrigued enough toÂ buy the sweet-turns-sour froth might add other menu items to their tabs.

        <p>
         <span __boilernet_label="1" __num="25">
          "Could it be driver of earnings? Yes," Saleh said. "One of the cornerstones of their same-store sales growth is beverage innovation," he said. Â "Theyâ€™re probably developing the next new product now for launch in threeÂ months or sixÂ months."

          Starbucks doesn'tÂ disclose how wellÂ individual products sell, but said in an e-mail that it's "been thrilled with our customersâ€™ enthusiastic reaction and advocacy for the Unicorn Frappuccino; itâ€™s fandom has exceeded everyoneâ€™s expectations."

          Anne Balazs, interim dean of Eastern Michigan University's College of the Business and a professor of marketing, sees the pink drink and similar items as fads designed toÂ shake things up a bit.

          "The launch of extreme or bizarre foods is an effort to capture the zeitgeist of the market," she said. "Such efforts are very short-lived, result in freeÂ publicity, often profitable, and sharply decline in effect.Â The fad is remembered long after the demand.Â It is a relatively quick way to breathe life into flat sales."

          "When I was picking up my daily coffee, I saw aÂ sign by their menu and decided why not, I'llÂ try it," she said.Â "Itâ€™ll probably be a very cute photo and I could show it to my baby cousins," she added before posting the photo on Instagram and on her blog and sharingÂ it on Facebook. "IÂ love trying weird things."
