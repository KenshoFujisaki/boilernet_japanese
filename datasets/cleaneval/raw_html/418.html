   </ul> 
   <p> <span __num="9" __label="true"> WARNER: The Committee will now come to order. We have before us a very distinguishedarray of aviators this morning. And our subcommittee, as the first hearing, leads off with someof the tough challenges. And we welcome you. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="10" __label="true"> I'm going to put brief remarks in the record, but just sitting here thinking back over a lifetimeof my own if I had to figure out, Senator Levin, one or two disappointments in my lifetime -- thefirst was not achieving Navy gold wings. But unfortunately World War II had ended, and theydidn't need a lot of youngsters in the pipeline anymore and we all went home. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="11" __label="true"> But, ever since then I've been highly envious of those of you who sought as your professions-- aviation. It's a very challenging, high-risk occupation. I realize, and I think most realize,every day you get in that cockpit there's a certain measure of personal risk. I want to thank each of you and tens of thousands like you, where ever they are today, forhaving made this contribution to our nation's security. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="12" __label="true"> The work of this Committee, however, is to try and evaluate the various programs broughtforth by the commander-in-chief, the President, to the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretariesof the Air Force and Navy. And therein again, I've had the privilege of having a good deal ofexperience through the years. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="13" __label="true"> And it's particularly sad for me to address this morning the F-14 program -- a program thatwas brought in while I served in the Department of the Navy, and have spent a good many hoursin the rear seat of that aircraft in the early days. But it's a fine airplane. It has served the countrywell. And I hope that we can put fixes in to allow it to continue to have service to the nation forsuch service life technically as we can get out of it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="14" __label="true"> The JAST program -- I was sort of sitting here scratching a note or two -- the challenges hereare almost like going to the moon. And this time it's TAC Air. There's a high technical risk. There's a high financial risk. And there's a high political risk. All three of them are wrappedup in this program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> And we're very anxious to hear from you this morning on that, General, so I won't takefurther time. We're anxious to hear from the witnesses, but I'd like to hear from mydistinguished colleague. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> LEVIN: We've been together now, we came together some 18 years ago to the United StatesSenate and we've worked side by side. We've traveled the world together with prettychallenging assignments. And who knows, with a little luck, we might be sitting here for awhile longer. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="17" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, I'm privileged to have you... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="18" __label="true"> LEVIN: Well, I agree with that too... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> WARNER: ...the ranking member of our subcommittee. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> LEVIN: And I just want to thank you, Senator Warner. It has been indeed a privilege towork with you for these many years, and whether I'm Chairing a subcommittee and you'reranking member, or you're Chairing and I'm ranking member, we're working on so many otherthings, we've always worked together in a spirit of cooperation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Some of these people ask me about the U.S. Senate -- it must be difficult to work in the U.S.Senate these days. And I always say, No, you must be thinking of the House of Representatives,because we really work together very well as team in the Senate. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="22" __label="true"> And we've alternated whose been the majority over this decade- and-a-half and regardless ofwho's in the majority and who's in the minority it's worked out very well. And ours staff haveworked together consistently, so that's going to be the order of the day again. And it'snecessary, because of the challenges we face -- not as challenging as what you folks have facedin the cockpits over the years, but nonetheless, a different kind of challenge, </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> And the Chairman's mentioned a number of them, including a JAST program and some ofour other acquisitions. You know, why for instance, are we buying more F-15s and F-16s at thistime? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="24" __label="true"> That's a question that's very much on my mind as to whether that makes sense for us to dothat. But I agree with the chairman. I think the JAST program is one that we're going to have topay a lot of attention to because of the number of challenges that it presents. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> I'm interested in the digitization issue as to why we're not making as much progress with oursituational awareness in the air as the Army has done with its digitization program on theground, which has given it tremendous situation awareness. That's something that thissubcommittee has been pressing for many years, as well. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> So, Mr. Chairman, I also will put some remarks in the record which are in more detail. But Ijust want to join you in welcoming our witnesses and thanking them for their presence, for their contribution over the years, and again, saying how much I look forward to working with you thisyear again. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> WARNER: Fine. All right, General. Turn up the engine. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> MCGINN: Didn't preflight this very well. Can you hear me, sir? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> WARNER: Yeah, we can hear you great. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="30" __label="true"> MCGINN: Well, it's an honor to be with you this morning and talk about issues of such... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> WARNER: But you will need to draw that up somewhat... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> MCGINN: OK. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> WARNED: ...somewhat more closely. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="34" __label="true"> MCGINN: It's an honor to be with you this morning and talk about issues that are soimportant to our great nation, because in my view they're key to joint warfighting, today and toour success in the future. And that's air power. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="35" __label="true"> With your approval, what I'd like to do is submit my opening remarks for the record ... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> WARNER: No objection. No objection. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="37" __label="true"> MCGINN: ... and in those remarks, as well as in the other prepared statements that we'vesubmitted to the Committee, we addressed those questions you asked in your letter of invitationto appear before the Committee. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="38" __label="true"> WARNER: Thank you. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="39" __label="true"> EBERHART: Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a privilege and a pleasurefor me to appear before you to present an overview of Naval Aviation's present tacticalcapabilities, and our vision for the future. I would also to abbreviate my time here and openingremarks and submit them for them the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="40" __label="true"> WARNER: No objection. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="41" __label="true"> EBERHART: I would like to, Senator Warner, make an offer, if you can find the time I'lltalk to Admiral T. Ball Hayden, the chief of our Naval Air Training, and see if we can get you aslot down there in Pensacola to come down. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="42" __label="true"> WARNER: I hate to tell you. I started in the Yellow Peril, which was the old biplane withcanvas and whatever was in it -- I don't know. I do know those days are gone. Thank you verymuch. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> And I'd like to also recount just briefly that I had a phone conversation this morning withAdmiral Hank Giffen, the commander of the George Washington battle group. He's preparingthat aircraft carrier and his battle group to transit the Suez Canal later on today. They're en routeto the Persian Gulf to work for the CINC Central Command. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Admiral Lyle Bien and his battle group on the Nimitz is steaming across the Indian Ocean enroute to the vicinity of Taiwan, where they will join Admiral Jim Ellis and the Independence battle group in providing that tremendously capable presence to hopefully stabilize that area. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="46" __label="true"> With that, sir, I look forward to answering any questions that you and the subcommitteemembers may have. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> WARNER: Admiral. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Sir. Good morning, sir. I'm Craig Steidle. I'm the program director for theJAST program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Sir, I thank you very much for your invitation to be here to discuss the Joint Advance StrikeTechnology program, a program that has just transitioned to the Joint Strike Fighter program. Because it has been so dynamic, I have a short brief statement. I also have a more detailedlonger version I'll submit, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, all statements in their entirety will be admitted to the record, and you mayproceed with your short statement. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. Thank you. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Sir, we have matured from the JAST program and are now converging on an affordablesolution that meets requirements of all three services, plus our allies -- the Navy, Marine Corpsand the Air Force as well as our allies. Specific focus on the program remains affordability --reducing the development costs, production costs, costs of ownership of Joint Strike Fighterfamily of airplanes. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> We've fully merged the advanced research and project agencies, ASTOVL, Advanced ShortTake-Off and Vertical Landing program, into the Joint Strike Fighter program. And additionallythe United Kingdom Royal Navy has joined the program as a collaborative partner. They arecommitting $200 million to the program in accordance with the terms of an MOU that we signedin December of '95. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> Interest has been extremely high in other foreign countries. We've provided several differentbriefings, and I expect the interest to continue at a high level. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> The program focuses on a new approach for weapons systems acquisition. We applied therecommendations of the Packard commission and other experts in acquisition reform. Wecreated an environment that provides early interaction between the warfighters and the technologists in order to be able to make cost and performance trades early. And that's been asignificant part of the program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> We've done this by utilizing the integrated product development team process. Industry is afull partner in this process, and they welcome this tremendously. They have been very positivein our process and our way of doing business. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> The first formal product that came out of this integrated industry-warfighter technologistsgroup and teaming relationship was our initial requirements document that was signed by allthree services last August, and was submitted, approved and endorsed by the JROC in Augustof last year. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> We continue to be a role model for acquisition reform and streamlining a lot of initiatives incoherence with our industrial partner. We're just completing the concept definition phase. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="59" __label="true"> We'll finish that phase this summer, and then move on into the concept development phasewhere we will downsize from three teams that we have today to two teams. Each one of theteams will build demonstrators demonstrating commonality, hovering transition, flying qualities, as well as continue with our research and development technology maturationprograms. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Each one of the contractors will demonstrate two aircraft, and demonstrate theparticular attributes that I just mentioned. In conclusion, sir, we strongly... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> WARNER: Let's just stop a minute. That's a total of -- what? -- six aircraft? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="62" __label="true"> STEIDLE: No, sir. That'll be two aircraft. We'll downsize to two concept developmentteams, and each one of those teams will fly two airplanes each. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> WARNER: So that's four? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. Four airplanes, yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> So, in my concluding remarks, sir, the services stand extremely committed to the program asdoes OSD and industry. And I stand by to answer any of your questions, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> WARNER: One of the questions I will ask -- and I was going to send this up so you couldread it if you haven't. I'm sure you have read the New York Times article. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. I have. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="68" __label="true"> WARNER: And I'm going to ask you momentarily if you would sort of give us a side byside as to -- it appears to me to be very well written and researched. But since it's a significantpiece on this article -- and I commend the paper and the writer -- I want to make sure our recordshows any areas of which you as the manager disagree. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> WARNER: So you have it there. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="71" __label="true"> STEIDLE: No, sir. I don't, but I do remember the article. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="72" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get it reproduced for you and sent right upthere. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="73" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Thank you. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="74" __label="true"> WARNER: General. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="75" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, Senator, good morning. I thank you for the opportunity to appearbefore you to discuss Marine Corps tactical aviation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="76" __label="true"> I also have, in addition to the formal statement, I have some short opening remarks which Iwould prefer to submit for the record. And I would like to also add that on behalf of the strongsupport of the Congress and the people of the United States, the Marine Corps has always beenready to be -- whether it's forward deployed or on bases in the United States -- to continue to beAmerica's 911 force. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="77" __label="true"> In addition to the forward deployed forces that Admiral McGinn has mentioned and, ofcourse, my Air Force wingmen has around the world, today you have Marines and F-18Ds andE-A6Bs poised in Aviano to support American and allied forces in Bosnia. There are Marine forces forward deployed in Okinawa and on the main islands of Japan ready to supportcontingencies there. And as our Commandant has said... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="78" __label="true"> WARNER: I visited the Marines in Aviano on my last trip there. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="79" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Yes, Sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="80" __label="true"> And there are Marines embarked on amphibious ships across the globe supporting the carrierbattle forces with our Vietnam-era helicopters prepared to do the nation's bidding. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="81" __label="true"> All I can say to echo our Commandant is readiness is our business. And we stand by toanswer your questions. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="82" __label="true"> WARNER: All right, gentlemen. What I would like to do is to start with you, GeneralEberhart. And I presume you've had an opportunity to have reviewed to some extent the recordof this subcommittee as it reviewed the 22 program last year. And our major concern with thesubject of concurrency. Would you start, sort of as a threshold where we left off last year, howthe '96 program has unfolded to date, and what you would hope to do on concurrency issue inthe '97. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="83" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I have reviewed the concurrency issue. With your permission, I'd like togo back just a little bit further though and talk about -- we were concerned with concurrencyfrom the very beginning to make sure that we were going to get this correct. As such, we lookedat what the Packard Commission said about concurrency. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="84" __label="true"> EBERHART: We think this program complies with the, what was pointed out in the PackardCommission. Rand looked at the concurrency issue. They commented favorably in terms ofconcurrency in the F-22. And just to make sure that we had it right, as you know, the DefenseScience Board looked at this issue and submitted a report in 1995, which in our view supportsthe fact that it's not too concurrent. There is some concurrency. We think there will beconcurrency in most all programs today. But we're comfortable with that concurrency. Wethink it's under control. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="85" __label="true"> WARNER: We added to be 70-odd aircraft in operational status before the last milestone iscompleted under -- is it the T&amp;E program? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="86" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, before we go to full-rate production, there'll be 70-some-odd airplanes. Asyou know, when we looked at the acquisition reform of '94, they recommended approximately10 percent, which, if had we stayed with the original buy of about 700 and some-odd, 10 percentwould have been 70-some-odd. But as we've drawn down the total buy, and also extended theperiod of EMD, we think that's a natural consequence that we will in fact have more airplanes aswe go to full-rate production than this 10 percent guideline talks about. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="87" __label="true"> But we think the important parts -- and they have been, once again, authenticated by thereports that we talked about -- is first of all, the DT&amp;E, which we think is most important, willbe finished essentially by the time we have four airplanes. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="88" __label="true"> WARNER: For the record, spell out, I know what DT&amp;E... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="89" __label="true"> EBERHART: Development Test and Evaluation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="90" __label="true"> WARNER: Right. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="91" __label="true"> EBERHART: And then the initial operations test and evaluation, the Rand Corporation saidmost problems unfold between the 10 and 20 percent point in IOT&amp;E. And we will in fact have27 percent of IOT&amp;E. For these reasons, sir, we believe that concurrency is just about right inthis program. We'll continue to watch it. We're concerned about it just as you are, but we thinkit's on the mark. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="92" __label="true"> WARNER: Now, each of the us have different views. I think it's, really, one of the highestrates of concurrency that I've experienced. But that, in your judgment -- and General Fogelmanhas testified this week before this committee -- that degree of concurrency is driven by thethreat assessment that has been made by a variety of sources, by traditional sources, such that tohave U.S. air dominance in the theater, in the time frame when this plane is scheduled to come in, it simply has to have that number of aircraft, and that design of aircraft, to meet that threat. Is that a fair summary? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="93" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, we're concerned about air dominance. We're concerned about insuringthat we have air dominance as quickly as possible. And in our view, the F-22 does that for us.But again, when you look at the number of airplanes, the 70-some- odd, by the time we go tofull rate, if we go back to some of the other factors we talked about in terms of an extendedEMD in having a bi-profile that makes sense. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="94" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, but it's the threat scenario that's driving that quantum of concurrency. Andthat depends on individuals to how you want to quantify it. I mean, you very carefully havequantified it from a technical perspective. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="95" __label="true"> WARNER: I just quantify it based on past experience. I mean this Committee has gonethrough a number of aircraft programs that have not materialized as originally envisioned. Let'stalk about your fly-away costs for 22. Considering the changes in the program to date -- andthere has been a reassessment of weight -- General Fogleman went into that. Did you have anopportunity to be debriefed on what he said on weight? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="96" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir, I did. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="97" __label="true"> WARNER: To capsule the weight issue, as I recall it, was that he decided he could make adegradation in the envelope, and thereby allow an increase in the weight. And that degradationin his professional judgement would not substantially in any way affect the performance of thisaircraft to meet the threats. Is that correct? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="98" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir. That's essentially correct. There's a little more to it, but that's... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="99" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, why don't you put that in? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="100" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir. I think that when you look at the weight of the airplane, it's stillabout 2,500 pounds below what we think the max allowable weight would be for this airplane.We did look at -- and I think you know, and you referenced the testimony last year -- that in fact,at that time, we were concerned about the weight growth that we had seen to that time. Andwe've taken very aggressive measures to bring this under control. And we think we have todayto include weighing, to reviewing it every other week, to reporting it to the program manager. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="101" __label="true"> We have actually had the opportunity now to weigh some of the parts. In fact, we'veweighed about ten percent of the parts -- the actual parts that we've cut -- and we're plus 30pounds out of this whole 3,000 pounds that we've weighed. And then when we've look atavionics, we've weighed hundreds of pieces and we're minus ten pounds. So we think we havegood understanding that our model is on track. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="102" __label="true"> The situation you're talking about is where we looked at the weight that we had at that time,and what it was going to take in terms of thrust to get us the G available at 1.0 on theperformance curve. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="103" __label="true"> We looked at what that would cost us in terms of dollars to insure a very small change in Gavailable. I'm talking .0 something in terms of Gs. Very negligible. We looked at what thatmeant in terms of operational capability. And we believed that was negligible -- and it wasn'tjust the Air Force, Sir, we vetted this and vetted this through the JROC process with the othervice chiefs, the vice chairman and the chairman and the CINCs to make sure everyone understood what this meant -- negligible in terms of operational capability. I guess the bottomline is we looked at it based on what it would cost us to keep that .0X amount of Gs at this onepoint on the performance curve, and we didn't think the cost was worth it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="104" __label="true"> WARNER: Let's return momentarily and then I'll yield to my colleague. About the fly-awaycost, what do you estimate the fly-away cost of 22 in the fiscal '96 dollars? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="105" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I'll -- I get the fly-away costs confused a little bit here, so let me makesure that I understand it. I think it's around $70 million, but let me check that for you to makesure I have it right. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="106" __label="true"> It's $71.2, Sir. For the record, $71.2. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> WARNER: $71.2. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="108" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="109" __label="true"> WARNER: And that's predicated on 442 units? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="110" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="111" __label="true"> WARNER: Senator Levin. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="112" __label="true"> LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="113" __label="true"> LEVIN: On the F-22 concurrency issue first. Is there more or less concurrency with thereduced buy? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="114" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, in terms of the reduced buy, coupled with stretching out EMD, there isless concurrency. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="115" __label="true"> LEVIN: So that even though we're buying a greater percentage -- put it -- no -- even thoughthe full rate production of the F-22 is for a smaller percentage of the total buy, the concurrencyhas actually been reduced. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="116" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I believe that once you stretch out EMD, and you have longer to workthese issues and the IOC moves right -- the initial operation capability -- and you have moretime to work this test and evaluation phase, that that reduces the concurrency. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="117" __label="true"> LEVIN: Now you, in answer to the Chairman's question as to whether or not the schedulefor the F-22 is threat driven, answered, as I understand it, that it is in fact not being driven by thethreat. But I'd like you to put that in your own words. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="118" __label="true"> Are we producing this based on what is a proper, safe, rate of development, or are weproducing this quicker than that in order to meet some kind of a presumed threat that we'regoing to face in the out years? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="119" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I think that in every case, this is a balance between the threat that weanticipate and what we think is acceptable concurrency, and acceptable and affordable rate ofproduction. So I think we balance those two things, and that's how we decide what the IOC is. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="120" __label="true"> LEVIN: Has the concurrency rate changed in the last two years for the F-22? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="121" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I have not addressed a question specifically like that, and I'm not anacquisition expert. I will provide for the record my view that we have stretched out EMD overthe last couple of years. We've moved the IOC right. So to me, as an operator, that means thatthe concurrency -- it's not as concurrent. Now I'll have to ask the acquisition experts if theyagree, if their definition of concurrency is the same as mine. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="122" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. So that from your operator's perspective, there's less concurrency now in thisprogram than there was two years ago? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="123" __label="true"> EBERHART: That would be my view as an operator. Yes, Sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="124" __label="true"> LEVIN: I think it would be useful to give us those charts showing us those timelinescomparing for us the milestones that exist now to what they looked like two years ago. I think itwould be helpful... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="125" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="126" __label="true"> LEVIN: ... to do that for the record. Now the Science Board found that for the F-22, thatengine development and passive avionics were the highest risk areas in terms of concurrency. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, Sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> LEVIN: Could you comment on that? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="129" __label="true"> EBELHART: Yes, sir. And, in fact, I had the privilege of going down to Pratt &amp; Whitney atWest Palm a couple of weeks ago and looking at the engine on the stand and receiving extensivebriefings on where they were a year ago -- and where they were two years ago and where theyare. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="130" __label="true"> It's very impressive, the steps they have taken to make sure that this airplane and the enginewill be ready for a first flight in May of '97. And I'm convinced it will. But the types ofredesign we have done to include the advances with the Howell blade, we're convinced thatthat will in fact work. It has tested so well on the test band, on the test stand, and it's a go forMay of '97 for the maiden flight. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="131" __label="true"> LEVIN: The science board report indicated that about 20 percent of the avionics testing wasgoing to be completed before the Lot 2 contract award. And as I understand, Lot 2 begins atwhat plane? Give me their... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="132" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I don't have that in front of me. We'll see if we can get it behind here, ifnot, we will submit that for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="133" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. Well, my question doesn't depend on the answer to that. So whatever theplane number is where Lot 2 begins, it was our understanding from the science board report thatthe avionics testing would be 20 percent completed before that point. OK? Now, in terms ofthe engine testing, we did not have a specific number. Do you know what that number is? Inother words, what percentage of the engine testing was to be completed prior to Lot 2 production? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="134" __label="true"> EBERHART: I do not know, sir. I'll have to submit that for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. That'll be fine. Do you know how much of the testing, the engine testing, isgoing to be actual testing as compared to modeling and simulation? Is that something youwould know off- hand? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> EBERHART: No, sir. I'm sorry. I'll submit that for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="137" __label="true"> LEVIN: No, there's no problem. That's fine. Just submit that for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="138" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. Again, as an operator -- going down there, visiting at Pratt &amp;Whitney, I was very impressed with what I saw. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="139" __label="true"> LEVIN: There was a question, Admiral McGinn on concurrency on the F-18 E&amp;F and eventhough it is a concurrency question so let me use this moment to ask you about that. I think thatat yesterday's hearing, Senator Warner noted that there would 76 F-22s that would be authorizedand appropriated by Congress when the operational testing on the F-22 is completed. Believethat was the figure that was used. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="140" __label="true"> Now the F-18 E&amp;F program, it would appear that Congress will have authorized andappropriated funds for 114 E&amp;Fs before operational testing is completed. Now is that not evena greater concurrency issue then on the E&amp;Fs than it would be on the F-22s if those numbersare correct or approximately correct? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="141" __label="true"> MCGINN: Senator Levin I'd like to turn to my colleague Craig Steidle who was a formerprogram manager for the F/A18-E/F and I think he can give you a more informed answer onthat. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="142" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Sir, if you don't mind, I'll answer that. When we put that program together it wasa non-concurrent program with demonstrated performance at every milestone. Before we hadapproval to go on with the first LRIP buy, we had first flight. But before we were allowed togo for the second one, we had demonstrated 250 glides and flying of all seven test articles. Before we went on for the third LRIP we had another demonstrated performance. So it was avery non-concurrent program with demonstrated performance. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="143" __label="true"> The operational testing of that particular aircraft started very early in the simulators withenough assessment, first of all, and there was a long string. The operational testing finisheswhen we have a full suite of aircraft -- full suite of weapons in the inventory, but the airplaneis fielded before that with a list of required weapons suites that the service has provided for us. So -- I'm sorry -- but it is demonstrated performance doing milestones which continues onthroughout the process. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="144" __label="true"> LEVIN: Has there been any change in those milestones during the level of concurrency on Eand Fs? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="145" __label="true"> STEIDLE: No, sir. There hasn't. We've been on schedule, on performance all the waythrough. It's worked well. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="146" __label="true"> WARNER: Let me go back on the 22 concurrency, you're referring to the science boardreport of April, 1995, page 35. Do you have a copy of that with you, General. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="147" __label="true"> EBERHART: I do now, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="148" __label="true"> WARNER: Just a rough calculation, the American taxpayers are going to have about a halfbillion dollars invested in airplanes flying during this current cycle. That's a lot of money. Ioccurs to me that we should have some assurance from Congress that if you in the course of thisprogram discover, Jerry our problems. And that's going to exacerbate the concurrency problem. What procedures do we have in place for first, addressing those problems internally and makingsuch adjustments to the program that may be required? And secondly, informing the Congresspromptly of what you intend to do? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="149" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, in terms of specific procedures in place, I don't know. I'll have to submitthat for the record. I can tell you when the issues that you've talked about earlier that referencethat point on the performance curb where we are looking at what that would cost us to stay withit and also when we looked at a range issue, that in both cases, as soon as that was found out,that came forward to Air Force leadership, immediately went into the JROC process and we were over talking to members of your committee and yourself, sir, to discuss those with you. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="150" __label="true"> EBERHART: I pledge to you that we've learned from other programs, other issues, that thisbad news doesn't get better with age; that we need to go ahead and address the issue. Andeverybody who has a stake in the action needs to know about it and be involved in thecorrective action. In terms of the specific process or procedures that are in place, I'll have to gocheck with the acquisition committee. But watching that first-hand at that time, I was the J onthe Joint Staff and I saw that unfold, which really gave me a good feeling about -- I think it'stied to the new acquisition reform process and those types of things. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="151" __label="true"> WARNER: Just reading from page 35, quote, If there are significant delays in theaccomplishment of these key events and they're described earlier, or if the performance levelsachieved are unacceptable, the program could be adjusted by staying at the four aircraft per yearproduction rate for an additional year. And you giving the committee the assurance that they're inplace besieged us to make that prompt adjustment. Is that correct? And you will provide forthe record? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="152" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I believe they're in place. I will provide for the record what they are. Ifthey're not, I'll provide for the record that they're not in place and then what we need to do tosatisfy that requirement. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="153" __label="true"> WARNER: And I would like just a sentence in the letter that this matter has been reviewedby the secretary of the Air Force. I just think it's very important that a matter of this seriousness,that the secretary give you full support which you're entitled to make that tough decision for thedepartment. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="154" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I agree, and I'm sure she will. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="155" __label="true"> WARNER: It's very important representation to the committee. Let's proceed on to anotherissue. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="156" __label="true"> LEVIN: There's one... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="157" __label="true"> WARNER: Yes, sure. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="158" __label="true"> LEVIN: On that one question -- just on this issue, it's a -- we're going to need to be satisfiedon this concurrency issue. I for -- is not particularly satisfied with the answer that you gave tothe chairman about whether or not this was not threat-driven or not. We are not going to takerisks, I hope, to in this program. that are going to be driven by a threat when it seems to me weshould make sure that we do not make mistakes in the building of this plane and I, for one,would rather it be done right in a year or two later than to find that we've got to do a bunch offixes on this plane. So when you were asked whether or not it was threat-driven and then whenyou told me and your answer to that was non-committal when the chairman asked you, and thenwhen I asked you the question about the level of risk and the concurrency and the same issuethat the chairman raised, you talked about a delicate balance between getting there as soon aspossible which was your words. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="159" __label="true"> LEVIN: I'm a little concerned when you say as soon as possible. I think I would have saidit, I would have put a qualifier before possible, like as soon as reasonably possible or with reasonable degree of certainty, or something in there to give us some assurance on theconcurrency issue. But let me phrase the question this way, and you may not be able to answerthis, General. And if so, that's fine. You can do it for the record -- you don't have to worryabout that. But the science board's findings about the acceptable overlap in the F-22 programbetween testing and production depends upon requiring that the development and the testing --excuse me -- must pass certain key events which are identified. And this was what theChairman was referring to. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> In the C-17 program, which was also supposed to be operating on an event-based schedule,the production imperative kept us signing contracts even though the events were slipping. NowAdmiral Steidle, on the F-18 description, said that we must meet key events before releasingprocurement funds. It was a very clear answer on that question. And I think the Chairman'squestion may have been -- I may be duplicating the Chairman's question, but if I am let me putthis in my own words. Is the Air Force committed to sticking to achieving testing events as anecessary prerequisite to signing the F-22 contract? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="161" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, we certainly are. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="162" __label="true"> LEVIN: Pardon? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="163" __label="true"> EBERHART: We certainly are, yes. We have to go through those wickets, we have toestablish those goals before DABs and pre-DAB and DRB decisions. So we will have thosemilestones before we can move from one portion of the program to another. And we'recommitted to that. I think... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="164" __label="true"> LEVIN: And our contracts provide for that? Our existing contracts provide for that? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="165" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, I assume... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="166" __label="true"> LEVIN: Let us know, let us know that for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="167" __label="true"> EBERHART: Again, I'll have to provide that for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="168" __label="true"> LEVIN: We just don't -- we want to be moving here according to testing events having beenmet, not according to a schedule which is set forth in a contract with a contractor. That's thepoint here, and if you can give us that assurance for the record I think that at least helps me outsome. Thank you. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="169" __label="true"> EBERHART: And back to your original question. I think your choice of words is probablymuch better than mine, but I think the bottom line is that we are comfortable with theconcurrency. We think that the risk is acceptable, that we're not letting the threat drive us to dosomething stupid, something dumb. We're comfortable with that balance. And we're not -- asyou said, as soon as reasonably possible is probably a better choice of words. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="170" __label="true"> LEVIN: My memory goes back here not just to the C-17 but to the B-1 and B-2... Yeah,where we -- you know, we had -- somehow or other there was a window of vulnerability, andwe had to rush the B-1. And we made a mistake, made a lot of mistakes. As a result, it didn't have the capabilities that we wanted it to have. Instead of saying, look, let's build the B-2 and doit right and take, if we have, quote, a little more vulnerability for a few more years, my God,we've got enough capability in that area anyway, let's do it right. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="171" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="172" __label="true"> LEVIN: Instead we, I think -- and I don't want to rehash the whole B-1 battle -- but I thinkthe chairman's point is, and I would agree, is that we really want to do the F-22 right, and we donot want a high-level of concurrency. And if that means we get it done a year or two years later,so be it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="173" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. Sir, those lessons that you referenced are not lost on the Air Forceeither, and we're very concerned about those as we move forward. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="174" __label="true"> EBERHART: And we're -- bottom line is we're comfortable with the concurrency we see inthis program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="175" __label="true"> LEVIN: Well, you know, everybody has his own view. In my view, it's a very high degreeof concurrency associated with a high degree of risk and I've always been under the impressionthat the threat that was driving this not in a stupid area, but just we were at the outer edge of theenvelope, as you say, you fly on the area of risk and concurrency. And that was driven by thesurface-to-air threat. And I seem to have gained that from General Fogleman's testimonybecause it's -- this program is very, very expensive. It's consuming ever larger amount of theoverall budget -- not only Department of the Air Force, of the across-the-board tac air program,and that likewise concerns me. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="176" __label="true"> WARNER: Let's go to Admiral and the JAST -- have you had a chance to look at the Time'sarticle? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="177" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="178" __label="true"> WARNER: And are there areas in which you feel that you would like to put information,comments... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="179" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir, I would. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="180" __label="true"> WARNER: ...otherwise in the record? Fine. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="181" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir, I would. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="182" __label="true"> WARNER: Because it's an important piece, and I want to make sure that our record reflectsany thoughts you have. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="183" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. I think Mr. Shannon did an outstanding job on the article in total, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="184" __label="true"> WARNER: Did he interview you, by any chance? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="185" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir, he did. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="186" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, that's why it's outstanding then. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="187" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. There was one area that he linked... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="188" __label="true"> WARNER: Why don't you teach us politicians how you... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="189" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. He had linked me to the $750 billion estimate that he had, and I, in fact,went back to him after the session that we had and said, I cannot add my numbers up to get to that particular figure. Mr. Blackwell from Lockheed mentioned a trillion dollar program and aWall Street analyst recommended a $750 billion. They are probably -- they have moreexperience in this particular field than I have, but 3,000 airplanes at $30 million a copy comesout to $90 billion, and this is an order of magnitude above that. So I told him I had difficultywith that particular figure. Another area was -- in the article here, I just noticed and I'm sorry Ididn't the first time I read this -- airplanes will roll out in 2005. That's true of the test articles. The first operational airplane will be available in 2008. And the third piece that he brings in isthe fact that -- alluding to the fact that perhaps the Navy would possibly in the future notsupport the program as strongly as the other services. I think -- I disagree with that. AdmiralBoorda has told me several times that he fully supports this and needs the aircraft, and the Navyis fully behind it. Other than that, sir, I think it's on target. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="190" __label="true"> WARNER: All right. Let's address then the funding profile -- $131 million in fiscal '96. That was -- excuse me -- that was a cut of $131 million off a baseline of what figure? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="191" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Approximately $331, sir. It brought us down to about $200 million in '96. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="192" __label="true"> WARNER: Those figures -- you're going to stick with them? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="193" __label="true"> STEIDLE: I'm going to refine them in just a second, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="194" __label="true"> WARNER: All right. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="195" __label="true"> STEIDLE: I'll give you the exact figures there within plus or minus two or three million, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="196" __label="true"> WARNER: You know, while he's getting to the figures, I have to recount when I used totestify as Secretary of the Navy, we would literally have two dolly carts full of records behindus. And now I guess with the modern computer and brighter officers, we're able to to it with ahandful of papers. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="197" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Or submit a lot for the record. Sir, the exact figures... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="198" __label="true"> WARNER: All right. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="199" __label="true"> STEIDLE: I'm sorry, we started out with $345 million and went to $206 million. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="200" __label="true"> WARNER: Before -- OK, tell us what was the impact of that cut, then. Those are somefairly hefty bucks. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="201" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. If I could just step back for just a second from where the programstarted. It started in the Bottoms-Up Review in '93. At that particular time, the AFX programand the multi-roller fighter airplane were cancelled, were rolled into one in this particularprogram. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="202" __label="true"> Mr. Deutch in August of that year established a program with a memorandum and laid in awedge at that particular time in '93 for the program. Since that particular time, we've merged theA-STOVL program into it. We've gone from a technology demonstration to an actual strikefighter program and the wedge stayed in the same shape. And that's not appropriate for aDEM-VAL or development program. You need up front funds and the shape of the curveshould be a bell-curve skewed to the left. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="203" __label="true"> I went forward in August and July of last year with redefining the program as we put somemore substance on it. Went forward and then came on over here to several of the staffs in lateAugust or September time frame, after it had gone past your particular committee with this newfunding profile. I presented a profile that was going to use '96 funding to be able to do work in'97. That funding was quickly removed and the statement was put in that that funding should beapplied in '97. That was two year money. We could do that. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="204" __label="true"> The services came forward with a program decision memorandum in September fully fundingthe program to the new DEM-VAL profile that we're executing today. So, in answer to yourquestion, sir, the bottom line is we reshaped the program and we have the money in the rightyear and the funding profile was correct to execute. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="205" __label="true"> WARNER: What time sequence was it adjusted? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="206" __label="true"> STEIDLE: We moved the program four months to the right. I looked at some techmaturation programs that we're doing. We moved those in the out years. We looked forredundancies and shelved a few of those particular programs. Moved the end point out fourmonths. And the total program was then reshaped and moved to the right slightly. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="207" __label="true"> WARNER: I may return to that program, but I'll have a question for Admiral McGinn andthen refer to my colleague. The old EA-6B -- what a workhorse. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="208" __label="true"> MCGINN: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="209" __label="true"> WARNER: I think the taxpayers got their money's worth out of that plane, wouldn't yousay? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="210" __label="true"> MCGINN: They continue to get it Senator. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="211" __label="true"> WARNER: No question about it. The committee has waited for some time for thecompleted studies of Airborne Electronic Warfare Requirements. Despite DOD'sunresponsiveness, last year's Defense authorization bill included generous funding for theelectronic warfare upgrades and modifications. The committee's concerned that delays inmaking substantial upgrades EA-6B will prevent the Navy from capitalizing on prior investingin the advance capability, that's the ADV cap. Is the Navy now ready to move out on thisprogram and make it a substantial commitment to near term EW capability? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="212" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir, we are. We continued to wisely use the funds that Congress providedlast year, the $165 million. We spent 100 million of that dollars -- or we are spending 100million of that dollars in upgrading 20 aircraft to the block 89, the more modern block 89configuration. We spent an additional $40 million to get what we call band nine and tenelectronic warfare transmitter pods. And the final $25 million is going for 30 pods forcommunications jamming. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="213" __label="true"> In addition to that, we have R&amp;D programs that are ongoing to address the idea of a reactivejamming capability, something that you can use against a variety of threats. With theproliferation of First World weapons systems throughout many, many different areas of interestto the United States, we are concerned that we don't get so stabilized and solidified in aparticular threat system that we can't react agilely through additional threat systems that could beput together with money by a nation with interests counter to ours. So the reactive jamming isone answer to help us to be able to fly with confidence into an enemy air defense system in anyuncertain future. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="214" __label="true"> WARNER: I'm going to ask General Magnus a question on JAST. And mister recorder, canyou put the general's response following Rear Admiral Steidle's JAST comments so we've gotthat one placed in the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="215" __label="true"> General, is your invitation letter -- that is in our invitation -- we asked you about the MarineCorps view of JAST program. How would you describe the relevance of that program to thefuture of the Marine Corps aviation? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="216" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that you asked me that question because I had theopportunity this morning to speak to the commandant, General Krulak, exactly on that topic. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="217" __label="true"> WARNER: This morning? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="218" __label="true"> MAGNUS: This morning, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="219" __label="true"> WARNER: You guys got off to a good, early start over there, didn't you? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="220" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Yes, sir. As I've said, sir, readiness is your Corps. The Marine Corps has madethe commitment in a real sense... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="221" __label="true"> WARNER: You got a little sleep along the way, though, I served in the Marines for manyyears without any sleep, and I assure you that it helps. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="222" __label="true"> MAGNUS: The Marine Corps has made the commitment in a very real way to acceptnear-term risk in our strike fire community, our AV-8B Harriers and our F/A-18s. We're puttingour, literally our investment, our money where our mouth is, and the technology leap that wesee is in the joint strike fighter program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="223" __label="true"> We believe that we and the nation, our wingmen in the Air Force as well as our shipmates inthe Navy, urgently need the joint strike fighter, and we believe from our perspective in the Corpsthat now is the time to take the incremental degree of risk, we think, with the forces that wehave, looking at the threats that are in the next decade, to take that leap to 2008 to the joint strikefighter. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="224" __label="true"> WARNER: OK, so you're still on board. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="225" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Yes, sir. We're in the lead as far as our IOC requirements, and we joined,welded at the hip with the Air Force and the Navy in the urgent need for this affordable,survivable family of over 2800 joint aircraft. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="226" __label="true"> WARNER: Thank you. Senator Levin. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="227" __label="true"> LEVIN: Just one question on the JAST program. Admiral Steidle, the press has reportedrecently there's some problems with the release of proprietary information to competingcontractors by the JAST office. Can you describe what has happened and whether this is a significant problem? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="228" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. Well, there was, indeed, proprietary information. There was aninadvertent disclosure, unfortunately, at the fax machine. An enclosure to one particular letterwas put into two other letters that went out to the competing contractors. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="229" __label="true"> So therefore certain pricing and costing information from one contractor went to the othertwo. The two particular contractors saw that immediately, wrapped it up. I sent my securityofficer out there after it. We have statements to that effect, and we are providing information tothe contractor whose information was sent. I hope to have it completely resolved by Wednesdayand the release of our RFP on Thursday of next week. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="230" __label="true"> WARNER: Would you yield to me? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="231" __label="true"> LEVIN: Sure. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="232" __label="true"> WARNER: I -- at an appropriate time, if you're going to continue with JAST. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="233" __label="true"> LEVIN: No, I'm done with JAST. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="234" __label="true"> WARNER: I think, Admiral Steidle, you should -- even those this is a purple program thatyou're operating -- what's the Navy's perspective on JAST meeting its requirements in the outyear -- operational requirements? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="235" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Sir, could I have Admiral McGinn that, sir? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="236" __label="true"> MCGINN: Just as General Magnus stated, we are firmly onboard with the JAST program,Senator. Our need in terms of timing isn't as urgent as the Marine Corps in the 2007, 2008timeframe. But we have a road map to the future that involves going from where we are todaywith the types of aircraft and our air wings, using the significant increase in capability of theF-18EF and then blending that in a complementary way with JAST when it comes onboardNavy aircraft carriers in about the 2010 to 2012 timeframe -- about three to four years after theMarine Corps. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="237" __label="true"> WARNER: General Eberhart, for the Department of the Air Force... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="238" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="239" __label="true"> WARNER: Is it likewise your... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="240" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. It would sound like a recording. We're completely behind it, and weare. It's key to the Air Force of the future. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="241" __label="true"> WARNER: And in all, then, this joint program is working out well? As a matter of fact, Ithink your deputy, Admiral Steidle, is a BG selectee? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="242" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir, he is. Yes, sir, the Air Force's newest general, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="243" __label="true"> WARNER: Good. That's fine. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="244" __label="true"> STEIDLE: If he doesn't mess up JAST. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="245" __label="true"> WARNER: So we don't know whether you're really a general for about 10, 15 more yearsthen? Only thing I can tell you, colonel, general or whatever the case may be -- I knew GeneralEberhart when he was a major. So somehow he's made it, despite his association with membersof Congress. All right. Excuse me, thank you. Colleague, I'd like to get that one JAST thing inthe record altogether. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="246" __label="true"> LEVIN: Well, the follow-up on that JAST question would be you say that the competitorwhose proprietary information was inadvertently disclosed has now been informed of that? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="247" __label="true"> STEIDLE: He has been informed, sir. And I will go down on Wednesday of next week andpresent our investigation to them. That particular contractor issued a agency protest -- rightfullyso, in my mind. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="248" __label="true"> STEIDLE: I will present all the information to him, and tell him what our investigation inimpact of the disclosure of that material has. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="249" __label="true"> LEVIN: So, we really don't know yet what the effect is going to be. It's not been resolvedyet? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="250" __label="true"> STEIDLE: No, sir, it is not. No, sir, it is not. By Wednesday I'll have it finished. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="251" __label="true"> LEVIN: If you'd let us know the outcome of that for the record, it would be helpful. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="252" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Wilco. Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="253" __label="true"> WARNER: Just as a follow-on, Senator. Your program has recently progressed fromconcept exploration into the requirements generation and validation process. What will be thecritical two or three events between now and the award of the EMD to produce test aircraft? What has to go right, what could go wrong? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="254" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. We're starting... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="255" __label="true"> WARNER: Great staff question. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="256" __label="true"> STEIDLE: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="257" __label="true"> STEIDLE: We're doing business differently, Senator. We have this group ofcost/performance trades. It's never been done at that level before. Industry is a full partner ofthis. We are trading off the requirements base that each one of the services have allowed us alarge envelope to work in as we pull it down. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="258" __label="true"> Moving into the development phase, we'll award the two contracts to the two teams. Theywill have to demonstrate their ability to build this airplane with a high level of commonality,which significantly reduces the cost, demonstrate hover in transition, demonstrate carriersuitable flying quality, and continue on with the ground demonstration of technologymaturation. We need to mature the technologies before we go into the EMD program. That'll bedone. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="259" __label="true"> And our ORD will be completely finished by the year '99. And that's a process in itself thatis being done in the virtual world in modeling and simulation. So it's a significant change fromthe way we have done business in the past. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="260" __label="true"> LEVIN: Let me get to the data link issue on the fighter aircraft, general. Apparently, gettingtactical data links into the fighters has been a difficult issue for the Air Force for a number of years. Some have the perception that the Air Force has resisted adding that capability, not justbecause of cost but because of cultural barriers. I'm convinced that the added situational aware that sharing the data among various platforms would provide has tremendous potential for us. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="261" __label="true"> Are there fighter data links included in the com-links that the chief of staff has added to hislist, do you know? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="262" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir, there are. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="263" __label="true"> LEVIN: And is the... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="264" __label="true"> EBERHART: It's under the guise of sensor shooter, and under that... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="265" __label="true"> LEVIN: Would you just say that again? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="266" __label="true"> EBERHART: It's under the title sensor to shooter, and under that are the things that you're soconcerned of and so are we. And you're spot on, it was a cultural problem for a while, and in myview we might have hid behind the money issue. We're committed now, we realize howimportant it is to joint war fighting, and we're moving ahead. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="267" __label="true"> LEVIN: All right. And General Magnus, is the Marines committed to also adopt thatcapability? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="268" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Senator, we are. We, of course, field our aircraft in a common long-range planwith the United States Navy and a program that is unique to us, having taken over the AdvancedTechnical Air Reconnaissance System. For example, we have added a data link pod to thatsystem so that when it is fielded it will not only give us the capability to download thereconnaissance when we get to the ground, but will be able to give near real time bursts of thatcritical tactical battlefield information to joint force commanders and forces at sea. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="269" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. Admiral McGinn do you want to add anything to that? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="270" __label="true"> MCGINN: Yes, sir. We are already flying in many of our aircraft including the F-14 D, theJ-TDS, or LINK-16, which we have found provides tremendously increased situationalawareness and it allows aircraft in a particular strike package or fighter sweep to coordinate their efforts in a much better way than we've ever been able to do before. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="271" __label="true"> I'd like to also say that a Marine program that offers a great deal of promise that has beenfielded and prototyped is a digitalization called Automatic Target Hand-Off System whichallows a Marine on the ground under fire to digitally communicate right into the aircraftweapons system, in this case the AV-8B, but it will -- we're looking to field it in all of ourFA-18s as well. You know, actually put the symbol of the target that the Marine Lance Corporal in the trenches wants to hit, needs to hit, right on the heads-up display of the fighter aircraft orthe AV-8B. And it is a tremendous leap forward in close air support capability for the future. And General Magnus might want to comment further on that, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="272" __label="true"> MAGNUS: And I appreciate the comments of my shipmate, Admiral McGinn, theAutomatic Target Hand-Off System because exactly right, our forward observers, forward aircontrollers on the ground will be able to take the standard 9 line immediate air support requestand beam it up via data link just as the Admiral said, so the pilot in a strike aircraft that is lineof sight, but out of visual range will be able to stand off from the threat, receive the informationand roll in on the target. Coupling that capability with the emerging 1760 BUS digital capabilityin weapons like JDAM and JSOW, we are literally going to be able to deliver close air supportto troops on the ground at night through the weather in the future with precision, accuracy,because of the capability to pass that information up and then load it down into the weapons. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="273" __label="true"> LEVIN: Are we funding that program as much as we -- in a robust way, we, in this budget? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="274" __label="true"> MCGINN: I'd love to get an answer for you for the record Senator on that. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="275" __label="true"> LEVIN: And General, I take it from your answer that the Air Force is now committed tohaving the same kind of reliance on the tactical data links in it's fighter aircraft as we've justheard described by the Navy and the Marines. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="276" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir, to put a little more bluntly but you referenced it earlier. We're overour cultural problem that we had. And then to take it one step further, exactly what they just discussed, this interface between the digitalization of the ground battle and the air battle is key. In the past when we did look at it, we looked at it more of just digitalization of the air, and datalink in the air. And working that together is how we really become efficient. And then, oh, bythe way, reduce fratricide. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="277" __label="true"> LEVIN: Well, it's good news to hear your testimony this morning, and the budget numberswill be helpful if you'll submit those. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="278" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="279" __label="true"> LEVIN: Because that -- that's an area of top priority for this committee and has been for anumber of years. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="280" __label="true"> WARNER: General Magnus, would you please pass on to your senior chief of aviation ourbest wishes for a speedy recovery from his operation and so forth? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="281" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Blot is recovering well. He has hadshoulder surgery, for your information. And the reason why he's not here is obviously he's fairlyuncomfortable -- doing very well but couldn't get into his uniform. So he sent me to speak toyou this morning. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="282" __label="true"> WARNER: Glad to have you. Let's talk about your CV-22 and the problems that have been expressed by the retiring chief of the U.S. special operations command. What do you have toenlighten us on that? Have you read that article? If not, I'll send it up so you can skim it for aminute. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="283" __label="true"> MAGNUS: I'm not sure which article to which you're referring -- although there have beenseveral that I've read in the last few days. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="284" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, let's work off the the same baseline, and I'll go to another question. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="285" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, I am familiar with this article. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="286" __label="true"> WARNER: Well, why don't you go ahead then? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="287" __label="true"> MAGNUS: The joint V-22 program, I believe, is a success story, and of course like manyother large programs that are in engineering and manufacturing development we're constantlychallenged by constrained fiscal resources. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="288" __label="true"> When the Department of Defense had a defense acquisition board and a defense resourcesboard in 1994 joining the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command requirement for a specialoperations force CV-22 to the Marine Corps MV-22, the estimate for the development of theCV-22 -- the U.S. Special Operations Command variant -- was $550 million. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="289" __label="true"> And that estimate came from the United States Air Force, I believe it was AeronauticalSystems Command. Subsequent to that, the Department of the Navy committed, withDepartment of the Navy RDT&amp;E money, to fund that $550 million profile that we believedwould be adequate to provide to take the MV-22 baseline aircraft into a Special Operationsvariant. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="290" __label="true"> In the succeeding two years, Special Operations Command has defined its configurationmuch more finely than they had in '94. We -- the program office and Naval Air SystemsCommand submitted a request for a proposal for the development effort to the Bell-Boeing jointteam. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="291" __label="true"> And essentially, the response from the contractors came in at approximately $200 millionover what was allocated in the budget. Clearly, that presented more than a minor challengebecause we did not have, in the Department of the Navy, that additional $200 million. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="292" __label="true"> And something had to move, and we certainly recognized the Special Operations Commandrequirements as well as their need for a fiscal year 2005 IOC. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="293" __label="true"> There have been a number of meetings between the Assistant Secretary of the Navy forResearch and Development, Mr. Douglas, and the U.S. Special Operations Commandrepresentatives on alternatives in which we believe there are more than one alternative andwhich within the Navy's commitment to the $550 million we can -- with ideas such as preplanned product improvement -- provide exactly the kind of aircraft that Special OperationsCommand and our Air Force wing men need to be able to accomplish their critical mission. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="294" __label="true"> MAGNUS: There are ongoing discussions between Special Operations Command and theUnited States Navy. OSD has been involved in the overarching team that is watching thisprogram closely. And we have been, of course, in consultation with our Air Force wingmen.We believe there are more than one solution that will allow us to execute to our $550 millioncommitment and provide the Air Force Special Operations Command the aircraft that they needwhen they need it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="295" __label="true"> WARNER: That's reassuring and Douglas is a very able man, trained here by thiscommission, and I have a high degree of confidence, as do other members. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="296" __label="true"> Do you want to take a question or I'll... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="297" __label="true"> LEVIN: Just on the V-22 issue. There have been some, another press report relating totesting results on the V-22 which indicates some problems, unacceptable level of down draft orprop wash below the aircraft operating, when it operates at hover. Is there going to be anopportunity during the operational testing to determine whether or not that condition is real. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="298" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Senator, thank you very much for that question. We have been aware -- and Isay we in a personal sense -- have been aware of the down wash effect of tilt rotors, not onlyfrom our experience with high velocity down wash aircraft such as V-stal , but when I was a major I was on the joint NASA-Army-Navy-Air Force and Industry team that went out to NASAAmes and modeled the aircraft that was then being designed call JVX, which has since becomethe V-22 Osprey tilt rotor. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="299" __label="true"> We were well aware that the velocity and the footprint, if you will, of the air that is movingdown was going to be more than we have in the current medium helicopters, but, quite frankly,comparable to heavy lift helicopters, such as the CH-53 Echo; different, but comparable to it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="300" __label="true"> In other words, that we knew that people who were operating in the vicinity underneath theaircraft would have a high velocity down wash. And we anticipated this, so this is not asurprise. As a result of that, during our operational tests we have just completed operation test2B, which focused specifically on this issue. We better understand how ground combat marines,sailors and soldiers will operate under aircraft that are being flown by Air Force, Navy andMarine Corps pilots, and we believe, and I have personally read the comments of marinehelicopter support team members, lance corporals who have worked under these aircraft, whobasically say it is comparable to their CH-53 Echo experience. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="301" __label="true"> What I can tell you is, just like the CH-53 Echo, which went through it op eval in 1979, andthere were words in the report there that described it as dangerous and requiring specialequipment that we didn't have in 1979, we will find tactics, techniques and procedures that willallow us to safely and effectively utilize this aircraft. We have anticipated this problem and weare working with our joint wingmen on this as well as the people who will actually be the realcustomers of the aircraft, and that's the troops that'll be in the back. I'm confident that this willbe resolved. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="302" __label="true"> LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="303" __label="true"> WARNER: This is a question to all three. We'll ask General Eberhart, Admiral McGinn andGeneral Magnus to answer. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="304" __label="true"> WARNER: Over the years, the committee has taken an active interest in airborne. Part ofthis has been addressed, but the senator and I want to make sure that there is nothing left in this untouched. The committee has taken an active interest in airborne electronic warfare. Aninitiative by the committee a few years ago was encouraged by the Defense Department toconsolidate airborne EW into one program and to adequately fund that program. Today we havean aged EA-6B fleet which -- with much the same capability as in the years past, while the threatexpands and becomes more sophisticated. At the same time, the Air Force plans to retire EF-111. What is the importance of airborne electronic warfare to your tactical aviation program? What near-term capabilities do you have to address that threat, General, to the extent you haven'tcovered it already? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="305" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. Obviously, airborne ECM is very important to our program and thesurvival of our pilots and our effectiveness on the battlefield. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="306" __label="true"> We support the efforts that are ongoing to build the EA-6B fleet up, make improvements toit, to provide for our joint ECM requirements. We're part of the solution there, and not part ofthe problem. We're committed to it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="307" __label="true"> However, at the same time, I have to tell you that we have an insurance policy there in that aswe draw down the EF-111s, we keep them around till the -- the number's classified -- butsometime in '98. We can an increased crew-to-aircraft ratio, and the airplanes that we do retirewe don't take the date as moth them, we leave on the ramp. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="308" __label="true"> So if there is a hiccough or we have a requirement, then we can fall back on it. But we'recommitted to it. We want it to work. We know it's the right thing to do. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="309" __label="true"> You know, and the committee knows as well as I do, that we have to approach this problemfrom many different ways. In addition to airborne ECM, if we have better battlespace awarenessin terms of increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance so we know where thethreats are, we know what the threats can do, we know how to either attack them or avoid them,using Stealth and using PGM. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="310" __label="true"> We also have the nonlethal part of this, and eventually some day we think there will beinformation warfare ways to get in and help us survive in the battlefield of the future. And wethink it's important to work all of these aspects, and that's what we're committed to. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="311" __label="true"> WARNER: Admiral McGinn? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="312" __label="true"> MCGINN: I fully concur with General Eberhart's remarks, Senator, and I'd like to just add afew of my own. The EA-6B is, as mature an airframe and engine combination as it is, still enjoys a great deal of service life that is available to it. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="313" __label="true"> We have an active and ongoing operational safety improvement program that is closelymonitored by engineers and air crewmen and maintenance personnel in the field as well as at thevarious systems commands. It is a truly joint program in that later this month, the three servicechiefs will sign a memorandum of agreement that will solidify the progress that we have madein making the EA-6B fleet truly the nation's tactical EW force. I received a report from the wingcommander -- the EA-6B wing commander -- two weeks ago as well as one of the EA-6Bsquadron COs who had just returned from deployment over in the Mediterranean. They areabsolutely confident that the program is on track. It is properly resourced in terms of airframes,the equipment upgrades that are going in now and are planned, as well as the air crew upgradesas well. We have Air Force air crews flying in EA-6Bs in training as well as in operations, andthey have also coordinated at the EA-6B wing level with all of the services and all of the unifiedcommanders in chiefs and their staffs to make sure that the global coverage exists in terms offorward presence as well as a very responsive reaction capability should that be required in anytype of a regional contingency. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="314" __label="true"> WARNER: General. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="315" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, I agree with the remarks of General Eberhart and AdmiralMcGinn. The Marine Corps, as you know, has four squadrons of prowlers in the ICAP-2configuration. We along with the Navy are operating our aircraft to the Block-89 Alphaconfiguration. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="316" __label="true"> As I told you earlier in the hearing, Marines are on the ground today in Aviano and earlierlast year when there was the need to bring additional tactical aircraft into the theaters to supportstrikes that were needed on the ground, Marine squadrons deployed within 48 hours and wasflying combat missions on the third day from the time that they got the to order from the JointChiefs of Staffs. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="317" __label="true"> We were integrated with the Navy in carrier deployments as well as basing out of our base atIwakuni, Japan. We will support the United States Navy in fulfilling our importantresponsibilities in the Department of the Navy to provide aircraft not only for our own supportrequirements but to support the United Sates Air Force and our allies. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="318" __label="true"> Of course, the United States Navy has received a budgetary FYSYP up and some structure totake up the Air Force's EF-111 mission as those aircraft stand down. Nevertheless, andconsistent with the tactical aviation integration memorandum of agreement that the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations have in general about allof our strike and electronic warfare aircraft, we will support the United States Navy in fulfillingour commitments to the nation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="319" __label="true"> WARNER: Senator Levin. Gentlemen, I'm going to have to absent myself and mydistinguished colleague will wrap up the hearing. Thank you very much. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="320" __label="true"> LEVIN: General, I want to talk to you about F-16s for a minute. We've got a new definitionof service life of the F-16s which is now driving us to purchase some additional F-16s. Andthere's a real question about whether that's the right way to go given our other needs in the AirForce. But let me try to work through this number with you. We have a 20 wing fighter forcenow and I gather the portion of that force that is made of F-16s is somewhat more than half. Doyou know off hand if that's correct? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="321" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, that sounds correct. I'll get the number here as you... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="322" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK, well, than maybe I better get these numbers for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="323" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="324" __label="true"> LEVIN: Let me tell you what I need, because you may not have them at your fingertips. What I need to know is what was the F-16 requirement when we had a 26-wing force, what wasthe F-16 requirement now, what would it have been had we gone to a 36-wing force, which was the goal during the early '90s? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="325" __label="true"> Those three items I need and how many F-16s would have made up those three differentforce structures. Then I need you to translate that into both the old definition and the newdefinition of service life in terms of how many available F-16s we got. And that's somethingyou can provide us for the record. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="326" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="327" __label="true"> LEVIN: Do you know in general whether or not the number of F-16 fighter wingequivalence has changed over the recent past? Do you know that offhand? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="328" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, it is changed, obviously, as we've drawn down some F-16s, and we canthink of wings like the 474th at Nellis and other wings that have drawn down. And as airplaneshave aged, it's certainly changed, although the other fighter force structure is changed, too. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="329" __label="true"> So I don't have on the tip of my tongue what the relationship in terms of proportion of forceis in terms of change, but we'd like to show that to you for the record and the proportion of thedifferent blocks, how they've changed... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="330" __label="true"> LEVIN: All right. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="331" __label="true"> EBERHART: ...because that's what complicates this issue, as you know. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="332" __label="true"> LEVIN: Right. That's fine. Are you familiar with the Coalition Force EnhancementProgram? Does that strike a bell? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="333" __label="true"> EBERHART: I think I...no, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="334" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. This was a program that would have given the F-16s some improvedcapability, upgraded them, added some service life. And we can find that in a different way. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="335" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir, I am familiar with that program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="336" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. Was it our plan to use that program and sell those upgraded F-16 to our allies? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="337" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, our hope was to do just that and then have a device or a procedure wherethat money is supposed to be returned to the Treasury would be returned to the United States AirForce to buy these attrition reserve airplanes that we've just discussed. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="338" __label="true"> LEVIN: Do you know the cost of adding 4000 hours of service life to a plane under thatprogram? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="339" __label="true"> EBERHART: No, sir, I do not know. One of our big problems right now is that as we'velooked around on this and how much we would have to sell those for, I think the brutal facts arethere are no buyers. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="340" __label="true"> LEVIN: They want to... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="341" __label="true"> EBERHART: Just as soon have a new airplane. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="342" __label="true"> LEVIN: All right. Now, are you familiar with the JSTARS budget request in the currentbudget? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="343" __label="true"> EBERHART: Yes, sir. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="344" __label="true"> LEVIN: As I understand it, the budget would cut the JSTARS procurement in half duringfiscal years '99, 2000, and 2001, buying one instead of two during those fiscal years? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="345" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, my recollection was that we did, in fact, move one airplane right. I wasn'taware that we moved three right. I thought we moved one right. I'll have to provide that for therecord. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="346" __label="true"> LEVIN: Can you tell us what the experience with the J-STARS was in the Persian Gulf War,in Bosnia? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="347" __label="true"> LEVIN: Are the CINCs interested in more JSTARS? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="348" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, the CINCs are very interested in the JSTARS program as it exists todayand the planned improvements as we get on through the production line. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="349" __label="true"> Obviously, as you know, the bird that we have today and the production birds will be muchmore capable than the bird that we had in the Persian Gulf. And that -- we were all amazed bywhat it was able to do in such short notice. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="350" __label="true"> I think that in Bosnia today, people are impressed with what it's doing, although it's adifferent situation because of the topography, we don't have a pool table, if you will, like we hadin Desert Storm or like we imagined in the central region of Europe. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="351" __label="true"> But we have tools where we can go and take this and show the CINC that if you bringJSTARS here and you put it in this orbit, this is what you're going to be able to see aroundSarajevo. This is what you're not going to be able to see. So that the expectations are there andhe fully understands what this tool will bring to him as a CINC. And that's exactly what we didbefore we deployed JSTARS, so it's living up to the expectations, and it's allowing us to use it inways in peacekeeping and peace making that we hadn't envisioned using in a major regionalcontingency. So everybody's very impressed with what they see in terms of JSTARS now. Andfrankly, the move right was an affordability issue to make sure that everything would fit. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="352" __label="true"> LEVIN: Well, that's what troubles me is that we've got a new technology and a newplatform, which is working extremely well from everything we can learn, and we're moving thatto the right for affordability reasons. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="353" __label="true"> And then, we're spending money buying F-16s and F-15s for attrition reserves, which areonly created by the changing the program life expectancy of planes. And where planes could beupgrades quite easily, as a matter of fact, if necessary in order to extend that program life. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="354" __label="true"> I mean, it just seems to me there's a disconnect here where we've got a real need of a newtechnology that is proving itself every day in Bosnia and has proven itself in -- over many, manymonths in the Persian Gulf, and that we're delaying and using money to create a reserve whichreally, it seems to me, is not a realistic need when you consider the fact that we've reduced thenumber quite dramatically of how many F-16s we're going to need because of the reduction infighter wings. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="355" __label="true"> So, to me, it's a priority which is misplaced, but I'm not asking you to agree or disagree withthat so much as I need from you for the record the history of the F-16s when we had 26 fighterwings. Now that it's down to 20 what would have been had we -- the requirement -- what therequirement would have been had we gone up to 35? The impact on the -- on that requirementwhen we changed the service life expectancy of the F-16 and then we can put all that togetherand reach our own conclusion. But at least that's certainly my tentative conclusion. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="356" __label="true"> EBERHART: Sir, we'll certainly provide that and the chief shares your concerns there. Maybe not necessarily versus the F-16 but the importance of that JSTARS and we are relookingthat now as we build the '98 to '03 program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="357" __label="true"> LEVIN: OK. Thank you. And then my last question, General Magnus, has to do with theC130-J aircraft, and I understand that you'd like to begin buying a tanker version of that aircraft.Is that correct? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="358" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Senator, our current active force has 37 35 year old KC130-Fs and an additional14 slightly younger KC130-Rs. Based upon what our projection of the service life of thoseaircraft are, unfortunately the bulk of them are going to come due for block service liferetirement just exactly when we need to invest in aircraft like the joint strike fighter and V-22and the Navy's F/A-18EF. We have been monitoring the United States Air Forces C130-J program. We are enormously impressed with the improvements in the cockpits and the avionicsin the performance of the air craft. We believe it would be prudent for us to be able toessentially piggy back on that program. Fiscal resource constraints have not enabled us to dothat at this time. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="359" __label="true"> LEVIN: Now you just completed, did you not, the modernization of your tactical tankers acouple of years ago? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="360" __label="true"> MAGNUS: That's correct. We still have some other things that are being modernized interms of radios, global position, satellite com. So, there is a continuing strain, but essentiallythat is correct. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="361" __label="true"> LEVIN: And despite that recent completion of that modernization program, you want to startbuying some new tankers for reasons that you gave? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="362" __label="true"> MAGNUS: Well, essentially the modernization that we're talking about, that the Senator isreferring to, is sub-systems. Our concern is service life, fatigue life of the aircraft. Theseaircraft are 35 years old. We would have to spend an enormous amount more money to basically do a service life extension on these aircraft when we have aircraft that are beingproduced for the United States Air Force. They're going to have very low ownership costs, justas ours are spiking. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="363" __label="true"> So, we believe it prudent not to invest in schlepping old aircraft when in fact they're going tobe very cost effective in terms of life cycle costs and commonality. Very cost effective --C130-Js being produced for our wing men in the United States Air Force. So we look forward tobeing able to take advantage of that program. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="364" __label="true"> LEVIN: Thank you all. Appreciate your testimony. We will stand adjourned. </span> </p>
