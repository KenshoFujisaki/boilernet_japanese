   <p> <span __num="2" __label="true"> This document outlines the basic principles underlying the proper useof the optical radiation safety calculator. It is designed for assessingsituations in which the eye is illuminated, either to provide a stimulusor to illuminate it for photography, videography or direct observation.The optical radiation safety calculator performs calculations for radiationat visible wavelengths (400-700 nm), and near infrared (700-1400 nm). </span> </p>

   <p> <font size="+2"> <span __num="12" __label="true"> 1. </span> <a name="radiometry"> </a> <span __num="13" __label="true"> Radiometry basics </span> </font> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="14" __label="true"> The basic principles of radiometry can be found elsewhere (link to W&amp;Sref), but will be presented here in brief. Measurements can be made eitherin terms of radiometric units, which correspond to raw energy or power,or photometric units, which are corrected for visibility. When dealingwith safety issues, we are primarily concerned with radiometric measures;the same principles apply to photometric measurements, however, so whenwe use a radiometric term, the corresponding photometric term will be listedin parentheses. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> The basic radiometric (photometric) measurements are irradiance (illuminance)and radiance (luminance). Irradiance describes the total power fallingon a surface (such as the surface of a detector, or a tissue surface inthe eye). The units of irradiance are expressed in power per unit area,typically Watts per centimeter squared (W/cm²). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> When a surface is irradiated with a certain amount of power, the energycomes from a source. Most sources are distributed in space, that is, theyhave some finite size. (This size approaches zero for a perfectly collimatedbeam, such as might be emitted by a laser.) The radiance of a source issimply the irradiance it produces, divided by the size of the source, wherethe size is expressed as the solid angle (in steradians) subtended by thesource from the point at which the measurement is made. A little reflectionshould make it clear that the radiance of a source is independent of thedistance at which the measurement is made: if we double the distance fromthe source, the irradiance will decrease by a factor of 4 (inverse squarelaw); but the apparent size of the source will also decrease by a factorof 4, and the two factors cancel out. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> For considerations of eye safety, there are two principle areas of concern:the first is corneal irradiance. When optical radiation (particularly infrared)strikes the cornea, it can heat and dry it, causing damage to the tissue.(Infrared radiation can also cause damage to soft contact lenses at levelsthat are considered safe for eye exposure, but to my knowledge there isno published data on this!) </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> The second area of concern is retinal irradiation. Damage to the retinacan cause areas of local blindness ("scotomas"). The calculation of retinalirradiance is fairly straightforward: the total amount of power enteringthe eye can be calculated as the product of the corneal irradiance timesthe </span> <a href="#pupArea"> <span __num="21" __label="true"> effective pupil area </span> </a> <span __num="22" __label="true"> . The illuminated area ofretina will be an image of the source, subtending the same angle from theposterior nodal point as the source does from the anterior nodal point.Therefore, the retinal area is simply the product of the solid angle subtendedby the source (in steradians) and the posterior nodal distance of the eye. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> To convert retinal irradiance to radiance, we need to divide by thesource solid angle; but at the retina, the apparent source is the exitpupil of the eye, so this is the relevant measure. It can be shown by alittle algebra that this is identically equal to the original source radiance! </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="24" __label="true"> For the calculations we assume that the source is uniform. This assumptionmay be violated for real sources; for example, a lamp filament will have"hot spots" where the local radiance is higher than the average radiance.In these situations, it is best to use a diffuser to homogenize the sourceimage. Diffractive optical elements capable of diffusing a beam withina narrow angular range (such as those manufactured by Physical Optics Corporation)are ideal for this application. </span> </p>

For a circular detector, simplyenter the diameter in millimeters of the active surface. For a non-circulardetector, calculate the area (in mm²), then divide by pi (3.14159), takethe square root of the result and multiply by 2 to obtain the equivalentdiameter. </span> </p>

For a broadband infraredsource, the value here is not too critical, because the calculations arenot too wavelength dependent. To be conservative, use a value of xxx nm.Broadband visible sources are more problematic, because the "blue lighthazard" function has a sharp peak at 4xx nm. </span> </p>
