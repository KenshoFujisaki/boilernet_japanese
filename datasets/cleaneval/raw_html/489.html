And thanksfor supporting this legislation. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> There's a growing consensus in both Africa and the United Statesthat open trade and international investment are the surest and fastestways for Africa to make progress. That's what you have said; that'swhat Congress had responded to. For too many years, the world'sefforts to promote Africa's development were focused on aid.Development aid is important. Nothing wrong with aid. And myadministration has substantially increased aid to Africa, and weappreciate working with the members to do that. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/images/20040713-3_agoasign071304-515h.html"> <img align="right" alt="President George W.

Only trade can foster the sustained economicgrowth necessary for such transformation." This African leaderunderstands that when nations close their markets and opportunity ishoarded by a privileged few, no amount of development aid is everenough. But when nations respect their people, open their markets,expand freedom and opportunity to all their citizens, entire societiescan be lifted out of poverty and despair. This is a hopeful piece oflegislation. As America works for open markets and opportunity on theAfrican continent, we will also confront disease and hunger and theviolence that undermines progress and hope. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> I'm deeply concerned about the humanitarian and human rights crisisin Darfur, Sudan. For the sake of peace and basic humanity, I echo thesentiments of the Secretary of State. I call upon the government ofSudan to stop the Janjaweed violence. I call on all parties of theconflict to respect the cease-fire, to respect human rights, and toallow for the free movement of humanitarian workers and aid. TheUnited States and the United Nations and the leadership of the AfricanUnion are working to bring relief to the suffering people of thatregion. America will continue to strongly support these efforts forpeace. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> One way to spread peace is to encourage political and economicreform across Africa by opening markets here in the United States.It's important for our people to understand, by opening United Statesmarkets we make it more likely there will be peace on the continent ofAfrica. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> AGOA nations are strengthening the rule of law. They are loweringtrade barriers, they're combating corruption, and eliminating childlabor. They're setting an important example for the entire continent,demonstrating that governments that respect individual rights andencourage the development of their markets are more likely to groweconomically and achieve political stability. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> Like all good partnerships, AGOA has been beneficial to allparties. Free trade between the United States and sub-Sahara Africahas created jobs, wealth, and opportunity on both continents. Lastyear, under AGOA, African exports to the United States increased by 55percent, and African -- and American businesses saw a 15-percentincrease in our exports to sub-Sahara Africa that equals almost $7billion. The most notable gains were made by American companiesselling agricultural goods and machinery and transportation equipment. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> See, when you sell goods in Africa, it means somebody is findingwork here at home. Trade must work both ways. AGOA has beenbeneficial to the people of the continent of Africa and to the peopleof the United States of America. That's why this is a good piece oflegislation. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Since its enactment in 2000, AGOA has generated over $340 millionin investment and created thousands of jobs. Things are happeningbecause of the law we're extending today, positive things for people inAfrica and in America. The enactment of this law will help ensure thatthis mutually beneficial trade continues. Trade and investment fromaround the world is essential to world peace. The United States andthe nations of the sub-Saharan Africa are working together to breakdown trade barriers around the world -- not just between ourselves, butaround the world. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> My trade representative, Ambassador Bob Zoellick is in Africa rightnow. He's meeting with his counterparts from across the continent toprepare for the World Trade Organization meeting in Geneva later thismonth. These are important meetings. They're important meetings forthe people of the United States; they're important meetings for thepeople on the continent of Africa. And the reason why is because wewant to advance our shared economic agenda, and it's very important forour AGOA partners to help make these talks in Geneva a success. Passthe word on to your capitals. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> No region has more to gain from free markets than Africa -- that'sthe message. And no region has more to lose from a stalled WTO processthan Africa. By working together and by our example, we can show theworld that a new global trade agreement can bring greater prosperity toall nations. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Real prosperity is the work of many years. I know that. It's hardwork. It's hard to change the status quo. This law encourages thechange in the status quo. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="59" __label="true"> I'm so pleased and proud to see the ambassadors from the Africannations who are here. Thank you all for coming. You've worked hard tomake AGOA a success. You've worked hard to spread the message in thehalls of Congress, and your hard work has paid off. I share youroptimism about Africa's future. That's what we believe. Those of uswho are standing up here believe in the future of Africa. Weappreciate the commitment to freedom. We appreciate your understandingthat we all have an obligation to spread opportunity throughout allcorners of this important part of the world. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> And now, it is my honor to sign this important piece oflegislation. </span> </p> </td>
