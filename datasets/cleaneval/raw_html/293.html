Terrorism has been around for centuries and has survived decades upon decades of being "hunted down and punished." The mindsets of those who committed these crimes is deep-seeded in history. It's unlikely that they were significantly encouraged by one man's failure to retaliate. This chain letter's simplification of the attacks to a case of "bad parenting" practically excuses extremist terrorists as spoiled children whose misbehavior was not adequately corrected by a lax father. </span> <p></p> <p> <span __num="72" __label="true"> As a nation searches for justice for the most heinous act of cowardice ever committed on citizens, we are eager to pin the blame on anyone.

What possible purpose does this chain serve except to deflect attention, hatred and blame from the real monsters behind this tragedy?
