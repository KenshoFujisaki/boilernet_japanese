            <p> <span __num="9" __label="true"> March 7, 2005: Virgina Commonwealth University just passed a student-choice policy that gives students with ethical or religious objections to dissection the opportunity to earn either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree without participating in academic exercises they find objectionable!

            <p> <span __num="12" __label="true"> February 3, 2005: While we do not have a list of every class using animals, it appears that at least some classes in the timetable now indicate both whether or not a course includes dissection and whether or not alternatives are available. For example, </span> <a href="http://courses.uiuc.edu/cis/schedule/urbana/2005/Spring/ANSC/331.html"> <span __num="13" __label="true"> Biology of Reproduction </span> </a> <span __num="14" __label="true"> has alternatives available for all dissection requirements. It appears that once the emotions died down from the original controversy, professors and department heads were more willing to make some accomodations quietly! </span> <br> <span __num="15" __label="true"> In other news, April Kung at Virginia Commonwealth University is working on a student chocie policy at her school. We've added a link to the </span> <a href="http://ramsites.net/~kungae/alternatives-index.html"> <span __num="16" __label="true"> presentation </span> </a> <span __num="17" __label="true"> that she delivered to her department on </span> <a href="resources.html"> <span __num="18" __label="true"> our Resources page </span> </a> <span __num="19" __label="true"> . </span> </p>

            <br> 
            <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> August 18, 2004: The timetable has been updated to include whether or not a course includes dissection, but still doesn't indicate whether or not alternatives will be available as mandated by Recommendation 4 of the </span> <a href="EP_03_35.html"> <span __num="21" __label="true"> policy </span> </a> <span __num="22" __label="true"> . We have also found that department heads are unwilling to have us demonstrate alternatives to them because they feel the issue is too controversial for them to even discuss them with their professors. We hope to find professors willing to take a closer look at the alternatives, and to continue support of students struggling with this issue. Also, the effect of this policy is supposed to be up for review by the senate this fall; since it hasn't been fully implemented until now I don't imagine any changes being made but we'll keep an eye on it. </span> </p>

            <br> 
            <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> December 18, 2003: The school of integrative biology (SIB) here at UIUC has responded to our question about why the policy wasn't being implemented. Apparently things like the timetable and program of study are made up far in advance, so the first ones in compliance will be in Fall 2004. They made a change to their website so that the </span> <a href="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/sib/undergra.htm"> <span __num="24" __label="true"> undergraduate program page </span> </a> <span __num="25" __label="true"> now has a </span> <a href="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/sib/dissection.htm"> <span __num="26" __label="true"> page </span> </a> <span __num="27" __label="true"> discussing dissection in SIB. Finally, when asked why a student in BIOL 104 was allowed not to dissect, but not permitted to leave and/or use alternatives, they said that since it's considered a specialty course under the policy, professors don't have to offer alternatives. While this is correct, it seems that both students and teachers would prefer having the students learn as much as possible, so we are going to get some alternatives on loan and demonstrate them to people in the SIB. It is our hope that once professors see the alternatives they will agree that they're worth bringing into the classroom. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="28" __label="true"> In other news, you can see an article about our campaign in the latest issue of AV magazine (from the American Anti-Vivisection Society).

However, now that the policy has been passed we would like it to serve as a resource for other groups working on similar policies, and for individual students affected by this issue. We hope to continue to add content to the page; if there's something you think we're missing please </span> <a href="mailto:sila@uiuc.edu"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> send us an email </span> </a> <span __num="33" __label="true"> .

The policy marks the climax of a two-year student campaign and represents a compromise between student and faculty interests. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Among the policy's provisions, general education courses that require students to engage in animal dissection must make alternatives available to all students who request them. For other courses, instructors are required to notify students of the availability of alternatives at the time of registration. The timetable is also supposed to have information on dissection and alternatives for relevant classes. Students who believe they have been unfairly denied an alternative may appeal under UIUC's "Grievance Procedures in Matters of Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. Finally, the </span> <i> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Programs of Study </span> </i> <span __num="41" __label="true"> document and departmental web pages are supposed to be updated to include information on alternatives to dissection." </span> </p>
