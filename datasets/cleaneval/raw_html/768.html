All freshmen must live on campus unless they live with their parents or guardians, and all undergraduates who apply and meet application deadlines must be accommodated each year, according to director Linda Carey. </span> <p> </p> <p> <span __num="49" __label="true"> “We have a small, close-knit staff, and we all work together to try to accommodate students’ housing needs,” she said. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> Housing Assignment Services has changed and expanded over the years, reflecting the ways the University itself has evolved, Carey said. There are different housing programs and opportunities for freshmen and undergraduates, such as LIFE (Learning Integrated Freshman Experience) clusters and special interest housing units, which are initiated by students, she said. (For more information, visit [ </span> <a href="http://www.ugs.udel.edu/gened/FYE_links.htm"> <span __num="51"> www.ugs.udel.edu/gened/FYE_links.htm </span> </a> <span __num="52"> ]). </span> </p> <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> “With modern technology, students also have different expectations and needs in their housing, and we work with Facilities and Residence Life to integrate what students require and want in housing and their residence halls,” she said. Because they know what students want and need, the staff was asked for their input on the new residence halls that are being built now on the Laird Campus. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> “We work closely with residence life, which occupies the second floor of our building, in helping students resolve any housing or roommate problems they may have,” Carey said. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> “We also see that housing regulations are enforced, such as no pets, except for service dogs and small fish aquariums,” she said. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Computers have enhanced and streamlined Housing Assignment Services, according to Kirsten Brown who coordinates room assignments and has worked in housing for 15 years. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> “We used to ask three questions of students and then go through all the applications one by one to match students with similar interests. Now we can ask 11 questions, ranging from neatness to night and day personalities, and the computer compiles the information and links the likes and needs of students to help pair compatible roommates. Since we handle such large numbers, this is invaluable,” Brown said.

She handles administrative matters such as housing contracts and fields telephone calls from parents and students. “Many students go online to sign up for housing, and computerization makes it easier to accommodate them. The second week of the semester is a busy time during open room change for students who wish to change room assignments,” she said. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> Jolene Moores, room assignment adviser, helps students with current housing problems and guides them in the right direction when making decisions about future housing arrangements.
