She just doesn't like crowds. So there was no chance that you saw her jumping up and down with the Orange Krush on Wednesday night . </span> <br> <br> <span __num="56" __label="true"> "I don't go to games," she said. "I don't like screaming." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="57" __label="true"> She believes her crowd phobia has been an issue since around sixth grade. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="58" __label="true"> "I think it is because I am overweight," said Baltazar, of Richton Park. "I think people are always judging me. I know they are not, but I am paranoid about my experiences. It's been ongoing for a while. I will always to a level think people are watching me." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="59" __label="true"> More than three months after Quad Day, she's opened up a bit but still shies away from attention. Being a quiet person on a social floor can be difficult, but two women are dealing with it on Scott One. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="60" __label="true"> "I am not looking to be a social butterfly," added Baltazar. "I don't think it is something I like doing. I feel more comfortable sitting at my computer." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="61" __label="true"> She joined the Women in Computer Science club this semester as her social outlet on a smaller scale. The club has about 12 members as opposed to the larger computer science organization on campus, which boasts hundreds of members. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="62" __label="true"> "It's a nice organization because I know all the people's names," said Baltazar. "I didn't want to be in a big group." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="63" __label="true"> The club combines academic education, featuring speakers from Motorola and other companies, with a social aspect such as playing Scrabble at a coffee house on campus. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Baltazar again busted out of her comfort zone and joined the floor for a bowling trip to the Illini Union on Tuesday. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="65" __label="true"> "I hadn't gone bowling in a few years. I think it is fun," she said. "I don't watch bowling competitions, but I think it is pretty cool." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="66" __label="true"> So is she officially an extrovert? </span> <br> <br> <span __num="67" __label="true"> "I wouldn't say I am less shy," said Baltazar. "I think I am more comfortable." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="68" __label="true"> For Shannon Smith, the phrase Christmas in July means it's time to trim the trees. She owns one-fourth of a Christmas tree business, started by her father, and has always been involved. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="69" __label="true"> "We have pictures of me and my brother playing in the trees and they are our size. It's fun to watch over time how we grew with the trees," said Smith, of Woodstock. "It's a huge part of my life and I have a lot of fun doing it." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="70" __label="true"> She carried a little bit of the family business into Scott One. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="71" __label="true"> "I definitely brought back a Christmas tree and I am not sure if that is allowed in the dorm," she said. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="72" __label="true"> She becomes bubbly and excited when talking about her passion, but she's a self-described shy person. A quiet farm girl, whose favorite musician isn't the Dixie Chicks but a hard-core rapper named DMX. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="73" __label="true"> Smith is very comfortable in her shyness. She prefers reading to going out. Her roommate Leslie Selcke took her to a party early in the school year. Smith stayed for 10 minutes before leaving. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="74" __label="true"> "One of my teachers told me that when I got to college, it was going to be an open-your-eyes experience and that all the people who were goody-two-shoes in high school would go insane," she said. "I am pretty much the same. I don't party that much. A party consists of me and my roommate watching Disney movies." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="75" __label="true"> Smith enjoys quiet environments. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="76" __label="true"> "I like to go to different libraries and test them out," she said. "I am a nerd like that." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="77" __label="true"> Smith wakes up between 5 and 6 a.m. for her morning cardio workout in the basement of Scott Hall. In order to get good sleep, she goes to bed around 11 p.m. Few people on Scott One sleep that early. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="78" __label="true"> Residents organize a movie night every Wednesday at 11 p.m., held in the women's floor study lounge. And while it's an excellent bonding activity, it also leads to knocking on the women's breezeway doors from Scott One guys late at night, which can make it difficult for people to fall asleep before midnight. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="79" __label="true"> "Sometimes our floor is kind of noisy," said Smith. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="80" __label="true"> Resident Adviser Doug Bach said Smith and Baltazar are easygoing and have nice personalities, which some people might not see due to their soft-spoken nature. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="81" __label="true"> "Both of them are a little more reserved and quieter than most of the girls on the floor. I haven't seen too much of them this semester," said Bach, of Wheaton. "I do encourage them to participate in the programs. I would like them to feel like they are part of the floor." </span> <br> <br> <span __num="82" __label="true"> As a project early in the year, Bach learned some interesting facts about each of his residents. He said Baltazar enjoys online comics and Smith is a huge Nicolas Cage fan. The latter information is evident after walking into Smith's room, where a cornucopia of Cage pictures wallpaper her room. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Those pictures and her belongings may not be part of Scott One for too much longer. Smith e-mailed Bach a week before Thanksgiving break requesting a floor transfer next semester because the floor was too loud. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="84" __label="true"> "I took that personally because it is my job to make sure that everyone has what they need on the floor," said Bach. "It's important that everyone on the floor is able to get work done and get their sleep. I kind of feel like I am not fulfilling my obligations completely." </span> <br> <br> <br> <br> <b> <span __num="85"> You can reach Ernst Lamothe Jr.at (217) 351-5223 or via e-mail at </span> <a href="mailto:elamothe@news-gazette.com"> <span __num="86"> elamothe@news-gazette.com </span> </a> <span __num="87"> . </span> <br> </b> </p> </td>
