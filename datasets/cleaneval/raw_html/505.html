          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="57" __label="true"> [ </span> <span class="GramE"> <i> <span __num="58" __label="true"> page </span> </i> </span> <i> <span __num="59" __label="true"> 14 </span> </i> <span __num="60" __label="true"> ] The necessity for having a Leader among any group of organized girls is evident to all who have had experience with Girls’ Clubs. The younger the </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="61" __label="true"> girls, the greater becomes </span> </span> <span __num="62" __label="true"> this necessity for the presence of an older person who can steady their impetuous enthusiasm and tactfully guide their activities into useful channels. No matter what the purpose of the Club is, the girls are coming together because of some need in their lives. This need may be social or educational in character. But, whatever it is, a Club Leader who is far-seeing, wise in her judgments, and sympathetic, can introduce into the Club activities the elements which will meet the needs of the Club members. Often the girls but vaguely realize that there is a lack, in their lives. It is part of the older Cub Leader’s task to discover it and to meet it. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="63" __label="true"> The presence of a Club Leader gives to the proceedings of the Club a stability which is most necessary. The mothers of the girls are more willing to have their daughters attend the Club meetings when they know that the Club is under wise supervision. If the Club Leader is present at every meeting, on hand early to welcome all comers, if she knows What must be accomplished and [ </span> <i> <span __num="64" __label="true"> page 15 </span> </i> <span __num="65" __label="true"> ] by her suggestions sees that the Club does not wander from its purpose — she constitutes a help to any Club which it cannot afford to be without. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="66" __label="true"> When times of stress and disagreement enter into the Club life, the Club members often look instinctively to a fair and impartial Club Leader to make the necessary decision and to bring harmony to the ranks once more. A wise and tactful leader can frequently hold a Club together when, without her, the Club might have suddenly ended its existence. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="67" __label="true"> The presence of a Leader is often necessary for the constructive development of the Club. Many groups of girls have but few ideas for the activities upon which their Clubs should enter. Given a good suggestion from their leader, however, they are able to enlarge upon it and add their own ideas. Other girls have suggestions which are practicable for Club work only after they have been adapted to the particular situation at hand. A farseeing Club Leader receives such suggestions and tactfully modifies them for her particular Club. Such functions of a Club Leader could scarcely be performed by one of the girls themselves, for it is the more mature judgment of the leader which enables her to meet and to solve the problems of Club life. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="68" __label="true"> To the uninitiated, it might seem a wise policy to allow one of the Club members to assume these duties of Leader. Such a course of action suggests greater opportunity in the development of self-reliance. As a matter of fact, in most Girls’ Clubs the presence of a Leader is needed in order to insure just this training to all Club members alike. A Club of young girls without a Leader — a Leader who insists that all her girls, whether [ </span> <i> <span __num="69" __label="true"> page 16 </span> </i> <span __num="70" __label="true"> ] self-assertive or retiring, share equally in the opportunities of the Club — will almost inevitably see its affair, gradually drift into the control of a few natural “leaders,” and its spirit of democracy lose force. A Club Leader is needed among girls to see that the </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="71" __label="true"> honors </span> </span> <span __num="72" __label="true"> and opportunities of Club life are distributed “share and’ share alike.” Her presence should mean greater opportunities for her girls and, because she is there, her Club should be a more helpful and happy one. </span> </p> 
          <h4> <a name="who"> </a> <span __num="73" __label="true"> Who is to be leader? </span> </h4> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="74" __label="true"> This is the question which confronts many a Club organizer as she thinks of a group of girls whom she would like to see formed in a Club. </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="75" __label="true"> For the majority of Girls’ Clubs are formed at the instigation of some larger organization or because of the interest of some social worker or other broad-minded person. </span> </span> <span __num="76" __label="true"> The Head of a Settlement House gets acquainted with a few girls who are interested in sewing She thinks it will be helpful to have them meet together—and thus is born a Sewing Club. An extension Library worker finds some girls who are interested in reading. She sends out invitations for a “Book Party,” at the close of which she suggests that they meet regularly to read and discuss what they have read. The idea is enthusiastically received and a Girls’ Club is then under way. Or perhaps a Y W C </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="77" __label="true"> A </span> </span> <span __num="78" __label="true"> secretary finds a factory where the lunch hour is sufficiently long for some activity. She obtains permission to try out her plan and goes to the factory during the lunch hour. The girls gather around her. She tells stories or amuses them 4.vith “stunts.” The girls show [ </span> <i> <span __num="79" __label="true"> page 17 </span> </i> <span __num="80" __label="true"> ] their interest and she asks them whether they wouldn’t enjoy coming together once a week. They agree to do so — and another Girls’ Club has been organized. To be sure, groups of girls do organize into Clubs without any outside suggestion. Such groups sometimes apply for admission into a Settlement House organization. They have been together in school and now they wish to have a Club. In any case, the group of girls is there. They can be organized. Now what about a Leader? </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="81" __label="true"> The obvious answer to this question seems to be, “a woman.” And this answer comes naturally because women have successfully held the leadership of the majority of Girls’ Clubs. Men have, at times, wisely directed such organizations, especially when the Club has met for some class work and the man in charge has been qualified to teach in that definite work. But a woman seems especially fitted for Club leadership because of her understanding of the problems which the girl constantly meets. The Camp Fire Girls’ Manual outlines the qualifications of a “Guardian” (as the Camp Fire Leaders are called) in the following way: “Camp Fire Guardians are older women, who, because of their larger experiences, are able to lead the girls into larger interests. Mothers are urged to become Guardians, and the meetings are usually held in the homes or out-of-doors.” </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="82" __label="true"> If, then, a woman is to be chosen as Leader of a proposed Girls’ Club, what kind of woman is best qualified for the task? </span> </span> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Shall the organizer search for a young woman, full of enthusiasm and energy, or for an older woman, with the wisdom of judgment that comes with years? There can be no fixed rule to follow. Girls’ Clubs have succeeded under the guidance of [ </span> <i> <span __num="84" __label="true"> page 18 </span> </i> <span __num="85" __label="true"> ] enthusiastic young women, full of the “stunts” which girls enjoy. And they have been successful under older women who have had the spirit of youth in their hearts. The kind of Leader desired depends upon the situation at hand. The social worker hunts for a volunteer worker. The employer searches for someone to employ. In either case, the task is essentially the same. The social worker must find someone who is willing to take up the task and who will be faithful to her responsibilities. The employer must find a Club worker who is primarily interested in the development of the girls, rather than in the salary he will pay her for the work. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="86" __label="true"> Each Club presents its special problems and often the Leader should be definitely qualified to meet those problems. The Leader of a Girls’ Canning Club in the country must understand the art of canning and preserving. She will, whenever possible, introduce into the Club life those social elements which mean so much to the lonely country girl; but, first and foremost, the Club has been organized to can. And the leader must therefore have this specific knowledge. The leader of a Literary Club will of necessity have </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="87" __label="true"> a knowledge </span> </span> <span __num="88" __label="true"> of books. Her girls have formed a Literary Club because of their interest in literature. Her own acquaintance with books will enable her to suggest those books for study which will be definitely helpful and inspiring to her particular group of girls. The Leader of a Girls’ Club in a business house will grasp the various phases of the business life in which the Club is to grow, and will plan her work to appeal to and help girls who are in just that situation. The leader of a group of foreign girls will find it helpful if she is able to speak their [ </span> <i> <span __num="89" __label="true"> page 19 </span> </i> <span __num="90" __label="true"> ] native language. This ability of hers is the door through which she can lead them to an understanding of American life and its ideals. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Not every Club requires such specific talents. Most Girls’ Clubs, especially those among the younger girls, come together to “have a Club.” They wish to do many kinds of things in their hours together—singing playing, dancing and whatever else appeals to them. In the majority of Clubs, in settlement houses, in </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="92" __label="true"> Y.W.C.A.’s </span> </span> <span __num="93" __label="true"> and in churches, the demand is for a general Club Leader, one who can rally the girls, interest them in the activities of the Club and carry those activities to a successful conclusion. It is always of great help, however, in planning the work of any Club, to know at the outset what the prospective Leader is able to do in any special line. The Settlement or Guild director can then often suggest certain activities when she knows that the Leader is qualified to carry them on. The Club Leader herself does not always realize that her talents can be of practical use, until the questioning of the organizer brings the matter to her attention and points out the possibilities. This search for some talents often reveals others which are equally useful, and the Club Leader comes to realize this important fact—that Girls’ Club work is wide in its possibilities and its requirements, and that—whatever she herself can do well—this very training can be passed on to her girls. </span> </p>

          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="122" __label="true"> The heads of our large social organizations naturally look to our educated young women for service as Club Leaders. They have enjoyed advantages for which many of these Club girls yearn, or, perhaps, to which they are looking forward. To those who will never be able to enjoy them, the college or school girl can bring something of the happiness and of the lessons of school days. To those who will some day be college girls themselves, the Club Leader can bring—through their’ Club team [ </span> <i> <span __num="123" __label="true"> page 21 </span> </i> <span __num="124" __label="true"> ] work—some elements of preparation which are not to be found in the pages of the Latin grammar. In Hull House, the evening social Clubs (self-governing groups of young people) organize and meet under the direction of Leaders appointed by the Social Clubs Committee. These Leaders are drawn from the Recreation Department of the Chicago School of Civics and. Philanthropy and are </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="125" __label="true"> students </span> </span> <span __num="126" __label="true"> in. training. Such a plan is of great advantage both to the Clubs and to the Leaders. The Clubs enjoy the leadership of trained and vitally interested workers, and the Leaders enjoy the opportunity of contact with a Club, while they are studying to be recreational directors. </span> </p> 
          <h4> <a name="qualification"> </a> <a name="_General_qualifications"> </a> <span __num="127" __label="true"> General qualifications </span> </h4> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="128" __label="true"> But such specially trained young people are not always available. Many of our smaller and country communities have no specially educated women upon whom they may call for Club leadership. This should not mean that a Club cannot be started in these places. There can always be found a club Leader for the girls, if careful search is made. Many a mother has been found who has welcomed such an opportunity to meet with her daughter and her daughter’s friends and to be “chums” with them. Often school teachers have been persuaded to undertake the work; they have been glad to meet the girls in an informal way and to put aside the relationship of being the “teacher.” The Camp Fire Manual suggests these points in the selection of a Leader. “Guardians should be appointed from among those (1) who personally know the families of the girls; (2) with whom the parents will cooperate.” If a woman [ </span> <i> <span __num="129" __label="true"> page 21 </span> </i> <span __num="130" __label="true"> ] is vitally interested in the girls, open to suggestions, and eager to develop her Club, that Club Leader will render a service to the Community through the organization which she is helping. </span> </p> 
          <h4> <a name="requisite"> </a> <span __num="131" __label="true"> A fundamental requisite </span> </h4> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="132" __label="true"> Club Leaders of many years’ experience often realize that, while the question of one’s talents and specific abilities is apt to be a first consideration, it is, in fact, secondary to another. Without this other, the most brilliantly talented Club Leaders have failed in their efforts. With it, those coming to their Clubs with apparently empty hands have made of their Clubs vital organizations. This primary consideration is the spirit of the Leader. To have the Club do its most effective work, the leader must be wholeheartedly interested in its members and their development. Real interest in the girls means interest not merely in their meetings of one or two hours a week or a month. The influence of the best Club Leader extends far beyond these comparatively short periods of their being together in the Club, out into the lives, of the girls, whether at home, at work, or in school. She gets intimately acquainted with them and knows their family life, their problems, and their interests. No matter who or where the girl is, of what age or nationality, she will respond to real interest and will instinctively go for advice to her who she, feels is her real friend. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="133" __label="true"> “Do not go to your girls with any feeling of superiority,” a successful Club worker once said to a new Club Leader, “and don’t feel rather satisfied to think you are doing a truly good deed. They will feel your superiority [ </span> <i> <span __num="134" __label="true"> page 23 </span> </i> <span __num="135" __label="true"> ] and will resent it. Instead, go to them as you would to a group of people whom you have wished for a long time to meet, and as friend to friend get acquainted.” This key word “As friend to friend” is one which the new Club Leader may well ‘remember throughout her Club work. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="136" __label="true"> A small, unattractive woman once approached a Superintendent in a city Sunday </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="137" __label="true"> School </span> </span> <span __num="138" __label="true"> and asked whether she might take a class of young women. Thinking her services would be of no special value, he gave her a class of three. In the course of a year, the class had grown to seven. Two years passed and fourteen were in the class. The quiet woman had formed a Girls’ Club which met regularly at her house. She had called in the homes of the girls and had come to know their families. She remembered their birthdays with cards and went to see them when they were sick. She gave parties for them to which they were sometimes invited to bring young men. She could not direct plays or get up a Glee Club, and yet when her girls wished to do those things, they had little difficulty in finding someone who was willing to help them in that special line. Such instances as this encourage tentative Club Leaders who perhaps feel that they have not sufficient ability for Club work. A true, wholesome friend is what every girl needs and it is possible for an earnest, interested worker to give and to win friendship of this kind. </span> </p> 
          <h4> <a name="desirable"> </a> <span __num="139" __label="true"> Other desirable characteristics </span> </h4> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="140" __label="true"> To name all the personal characteristics desirable in a Club Leader would be to describe a combination of [ </span> <i> <span __num="141" __label="true"> page 24 </span> </i> <span __num="142" __label="true"> ] them which is rarely, if ever, found in one worker. A few, however, stand out as especially helpful in Club work and surely not unattainable. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <i> <span __num="143" __label="true"> Faithfulness </span> </i> <span __num="144" __label="true"> —how often has the lack of it on the part of her volunteer workers brought despair to the heart of a Y.W.C.A. director! And, on the contrary, how often has she blessed the Club Leader who is always present at meetings, always on time, and who has always made the plans for which she said she would be responsible! The best Club Leader places faithfulness to her word before her own personal pleasure, and her influence upon the girls is strong or weak according as she considers her Club important or unimportant. One Club Leader once wrote a pledge which, in her opinion, was the most important for a worker among girls to observe. The pledge was as follows: “I will always keep my promises to my girls, unless some real reason prevents. By real reason, I do not mean an attractive social engagement.” </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <i> <span __num="145" __label="true"> Ability to be fair and to treat all Club members impartially </span> </i> <span __num="146" __label="true"> is also desirable in a Club Leader. It is difficult to be constantly impartial when some of the girls seem so responsive and so well worth the effort expended upon them, while others are far from being attractive and are coldly indifferent. Unless a Club Leader is on her guard, she will quite naturally fall into the habit of referring to one or two Club girls as ideal Club members, and before she knows it, the rest of the Club will charge her with having “pets.” Those who have had little interest before will seize upon this as an excuse for their indifference. One Club Leader found her work made suddenly difficult because she had held up a certain few girls as [ </span> <i> <span __num="147" __label="true"> page 25 </span> </i> <span __num="148" __label="true"> ] a constant example before the others. This aroused resentment in the Club against the good workers and against her. She had, to be sure, </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="149" __label="true"> honored </span> </span> <span __num="150" __label="true"> those who most deserved it, but she afterward said that had she realized the consequences of her action, she would not have been so’ emphatic about the excellence of the few and would have worked more intensively with the others to bring them up to the high standard. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="151" __label="true"> The necessity for maintaining wholesome friendships is closely allied to this ability to treat all with impartiality. Any who have dealt with girls know what a “crush,” or passionate hero-worship, is; and have come to dread its appearance as destructive to team work and Club cooperation. Incipient hero-worship is but natural in girls. They are at the hero-worshiping age. The wise Club Leader will not shun nor treat with disdain the young ‘girl who dogs her footsteps. Rather, she will make of it the opportunity for developing a real and vital friendship. And by showing an attitude of simple cordiality and dispassionate interest, she will almost invariably be able to win a steady loyalty quite different from flaming and fluctuating adoration, and far more lasting. A director of many Girls’ Clubs once pointed with pride to the fact that this spirit of passion was lacking in all of her organization. “Some people will tell you that it is impossible to carry on Girls’ Club work without it,” she remarked, “but it is possible and we know it because we have done it. To be sure, we have had a policy of aiming at wholesome friendships and have kept it constantly before us. More than this, we have </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="152" __label="true"> endeavored </span> </span> <span __num="153" __label="true"> to have our own friendships for each [ </span> <i> <span __num="154" __label="true"> page 26 </span> </i> <span __num="155" __label="true"> ] other on the high plane of balance and sanity. All of this has helped and we are proud of the result.” </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <i> <span __num="156" __label="true"> Power to see things in the same way as her girls </span> </i> <span __num="157" __label="true"> is of greatest value to the Club Leader. When she knows their home life and their training, or lack of it, there comes to her an understanding of their actions. “Before I give any advice, I always try to put myself in the girl’s place,” one Club Leader has said. “It’s surprising bow often this changes what I had meant to say </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="158"> !“ </span> </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="159" __label="true"> Lack of this very ability to put herself in the girl’s place has brought misunderstanding and even failure into the life of many a Leader. A Club Leader in a business house once decided to organize a Club among some young girls to meet during the lunch hour. The girls were interested in dancing, so she taught them simple folk dances. At the outset, she had had in mind the conducting of a class like the Physical Training classes she had conducted in her gymnasium. She soon found that she could not do it in that way. At first she was inclined to reprimand the girls for getting out of line and for giggling, but when she stopped to consider the fact that lunch time was their only free hour during the day, she soon lost all desire to see them standing in rows,’ learning steps the entire time. So there was no reprimand for the girls who laughed heartily at their own efforts to do the dances. She provided songs and games for part of the half-hour with the result that when the time came for the dance work, the girls invariably gave earnest attention to it. The result of this policy on her part was the creation of an atmosphere of sociability and enjoyment rather than of work to be done. [ </span> <span class="GramE"> <i> <span __num="160" __label="true"> page </span> </i> </span> <i> <span __num="161" __label="true"> 27 </span> </i> <span __num="162" __label="true"> ] </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="163" __label="true"> A visiting Club Leader complained of her inability to hold her girls during lunch hour in a similar Club. The first leader visited the other’s rooms and talked with the girls. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="164" __label="true"> “She makes us work all the time on those dances,” objected one, “and she says we’re silly when we laugh. How would you like to work all day and never laugh even on your lunch hour </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="165"> ?“ </span> </span> <span __num="166" __label="true"> The second Club Leader could not have made this mistake bad she been able to sympathetically put herself in the place of her Club members. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="GramE"> <i> <span __num="167" __label="true"> Self-Control </span> </i> <span __num="168" __label="true"> . </span> </span> <span __num="169" __label="true"> Perplexing situations are sure to arise in the life of a Club, such as try the Leader’s patience to the utmost. If, through them all, she is able to preserve her self-control, she will have contributed vitally to the development of her girls, who are often sadly in need of that very self-control. The force of a good example is perhaps never exerted more powerfully’ than in showing control of one’s temper when the Club work is difficult. “She never gets mad when you’re bad,” said one girl of a beloved Camp Director, “but she makes you feel pretty mean when you break rules, because she’s always so sorry about it!” </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="170" __label="true"> And so it would be possible to make a long list of personal characteristics which enable a Club Leader to exert a helpful influence upon her girls. Perhaps the best general rule for the Leader is to always try to be what she wishes her girls to be. If her ideal is sufficiently high, she will never attain it. But in the striving, she will help not only her girls but also herself, immeasurably. [ </span> <span class="GramE"> <i> <span __num="171" __label="true"> page </span> </i> </span> <i> <span __num="172" __label="true"> 28 </span> </i> <span __num="173" __label="true"> ] </span> </p> 
          <h4> <a name="acquanited"> </a> <span __num="174" __label="true"> Getting acquainted with the girls </span> </h4> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="175" __label="true"> The earnest Club Leader will at once set about getting acquainted with her girls in as vital a way as possible. She has been given a group of girls to lead along the lines of useful development. The activities of the Club and her personal relationship with them must further this aim. In order to accomplish this, she must know each girl. Her help can then be given wisely. But such acquaintance cannot be gained, at once, nor without definitely searching for it. For “knowing each girl” means far more than being able to recognize her upon the street and calling her by name. It includes acquaintance with her family and her home life, her education, her surroundings, her interests—in short, an acquaintance with the forces which have made her what she is. If, a Leader has definitely in mind what she wishes to, know about her girls, any conversation will give her an opportunity to learn the desired facts. It may be some time before the Leader knows all that she wishes concerning her girls. Many Club Leaders have found it far wiser to approach the girls gradually than to go to them in the attitude of a cross-questioner and by constant questioning to arouse their suspicions and antagonism. A friend, however, confides in a friend. Once a Club Leader has proved herself a friend to her girls, girlish confidences follow and the Leader is in a position to advise and direct wisely. </span> </p>

The Club meets for one or two hours every week or two weeks. Think of the many other hours during each week when other forces, for good and for evil, are touching those same lives! “What are they?

Often they present themselves through the desires or needs of the girls. One of the Club girls wishes to join a church. What is the best one for her, in the section where she lives? A Club member is eager to study stenography and typewriting. Where is the most thorough course given, and at what price? The father of one of the Club girls is living a life harmful to the best interests of the family. What organization should she consult for help? The Club wishes to give some financial help to some good cause in the community. What shall it be? Such questions as these arise constantly in a growing Girls’ Club. The alert Club Leader who knows the organizations and opportunities of her own district or town is able to answer them with practical, definite suggestions, which the girls can put into action.

          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="383" __label="true"> Perhaps nothing is of more inspirational help to a Club Leader than meeting others who are also interested in girls and who are dealing with the same problems. Great benefit is to be gained from such personal contact and from informal discussion of these problems. Those who direct large organizations made up of many Clubs have long since realized the importance of gathering Club Leaders together. And so it is that we see the Club Leaders of a Settlement House meeting to discuss their plans; the Secretaries and the volunteer workers in a Y. W. C. A. coming together; we hear of Camp Fire Guardians or Girl Scout Captains conferring in special sessions. In many parts of the United States such gatherings are not limited to single organizations. Groups of leaders have been formed that are city-wide, county-wide, and even country-wide. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="384" __label="true"> In Philadelphia the leaders of girls in that city are united in the Girls’ Conference. All organizations interested in work for girls are invited to join. The conference is an open forum for the discussion of city-girl problems. Four or more meetings are held in the course of the year, and the problems are then presented and discussed. The roll of the Girls’ Conference includes organizations of all kinds—religious (Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant); remedial organizations; educational organizations; and recreational organizations. The executive board of this Conference includes a Girls’ High School principal, representatives from the Catholic, Jewish, and </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="385" __label="true"> Colored </span> </span> <span __num="386" __label="true"> , organizations of the city, and representatives from such organizations as the </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="387" __label="true"> Salvation &nbsp;[ </span> </span> <i> <span __num="388" __label="true"> page 37 </span> </i> <span __num="389" __label="true"> ] Army, the Y. W. C. A., the Girls’ Aid Society, and the </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="390" __label="true"> Travelers </span> </span> <span __num="391" __label="true"> ’ Aid Society. A meeting of a committee of this kind gives many points of view concerning the girls of the community. The following subjects which the Philadelphia Girls’ Conference has considered show the practical problems which have come before them: “Closer cooperation of all field workers”; “Vocational training and guidance and follow-up work of girls obtaining working papers, with special attention to recreation and character building”; “Social Service for cases heard in Magistrates’ Court”; “Work with girls and women in War Times”; “Constructive War Work with girls,” and “Recreation of women affected by War-Time Activities.” </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="392" __label="true"> In smaller communities, it is possible to bring together the school teachers and the Sunday- School teachers as well as those directly concerned with Club work. The Boys’ and Girls’ Agricultural Clubs, which have been largely promoted under the auspices of the United States Government, have used the county as a unit, and within a county have brought the Clubs and Club Leaders into personal touch with one another. In this way there has been created a cordial friendliness and cooperation. </span> </p>

          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="438" __label="true"> Many books have been written which touch upon the various phases of Girls’ Club work, and the periodicals which are published by the various organizations give to every Club Leader a splendid opportunity for gathering new ideas for her Club. The Camp Fire Girls’ Handbook (fifty cents); the Handbook for Girl Scouts (thirty cents); the Woodcraft Manual for Girls of the Woodcraft League (fifty cents)—all of these outline in greatest detail many activities for girls. The monthly publications of the large organizations of girls and young women give many suggestions for the actual carrying out of these activities. There is no issue of the following Girls’ - Club magazines which does not contain definite suggestions for Club work, either in the special articles written by trained Club workers, or in the reports which the girls themselves contribute. Any Girls’ Club Leader will find help in the “Association Monthly” (Y. W. C. A. publication, one dollar a year); “ </span> <span class="SpellE"> <span __num="439" __label="true"> Wohelo </span> </span> <span __num="440" __label="true"> ” (Camp Fire Girls’ Magazine, one dollar a year); “The Rally” (Girl Scouts’ Magazine, one dollar a year); “The Club Worker” (published by the National League of Women Workers, thirty cents a year). By subscribing to one or all of these publications any Club Leader can, at </span> <span class="GramE"> <span __num="441" __label="true"> a &nbsp;[ </span> </span> <i> <span __num="442" __label="true"> page 40 </span> </i> <span __num="443" __label="true"> ] small expense, receive a constant influx of new ideas. It matters little whether or not she has a group of girls under any of these particular organizations; there is suggestion and inspiration for her in all work which is being carried on among girls. </span> </p>

          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="445" __label="true"> Many Club Leaders have found that there are others living in the same community who are willing to help in the work of their Clubs. These others are not willing to undertake the work of a Club, but they are glad to give their help in coaching a play, in training a Glee Club for a certain concert, or in arranging for a special outing. The Club Leader who makes use of not only her own talents but also those of her friends finds help waiting for her where she may least expect it. </span> </p> 
          <p class="MsoNormal"> <span __num="446" __label="true"> One Club Leader in a large city successfully introduced the “Big Sister” idea into her Club work. Her girls were of a kind who needed a large amount of individual attention. She herself was unable to give it. So she sought the help of a number of her friends, asking each one to take one girl in the Club and be her “big Sister,” taking her out to wholesome pleasures, watching her, and advising her. The plan was well worth the effort, and the girls profited by these helpful friendships. </span> </p>
