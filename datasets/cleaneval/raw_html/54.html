      <h1> <span __num="7" __label="true"> Standing in the Way of Ceremony: Production Code Objections to </span> <i> <span __num="8" __label="true"> The Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> </h1> 
      <span __num="9" __label="true"> The year was 1931. Universal was a struggling Hollywood studio. Salvationcame from an unexpected place: the horror film. February saw the blockbusterrelease of </span> 
      <i> <span __num="10" __label="true"> Dracula </span> </i> 
      <span __num="11" __label="true"> , and only eight months later </span> 
      <i> <span __num="12" __label="true"> Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="13" __label="true"> was released to become an even bigger hit. Inevitably this successled the studio to pursue a sequel, and in 1935 Universal released </span> 
      <i> <span __num="14" __label="true"> The Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="15" __label="true"> , returning the director (JamesWhale) and most of the original cast. The film was a spectacular successat the box office. What the average 1935 movie-goer saw in the theater,though, was a film heavily tweaked from the original script Whalehad been pursuing. Unlike its predecessor, </span> 
      <i> <span __num="16" __label="true"> The Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="17" __label="true"> was exposed to the heavy hand of Joe Breen and the Production CodeAdministration; a review of the shooting script and notes Breen wroteto the producers reveal forced alterations that change the natureof the film and its characters. </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="18" __label="true"> When the original </span> 
      <i> <span __num="19" __label="true"> Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="20" __label="true"> was released in 1931 the ProductionCode had not yet been put into enforcement. Censorship was yet thedominion of various local and state film boards. Though these groupscut various scenes from the screened prints of the original, therewas no federal censorship to deal with until the film's re-releasein 1937 (Manguel 14). </span> 
      <i> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="22" __label="true"> , however, hadto deal with the Production Code Administration from the beginning.Many cases of censorship centered around the depiction of the femaleform and sexuality, but for the most part the issues raised in </span> 
      <i> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Brideof Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="24" __label="true"> were ones of violence and religion. </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="25" __label="true"> Breen, as a devout Catholic, was especially sensitive to unfavorableportrayals of religion in the movies. In this film Breen was especiallyworried by any scenes that would compare Frankenstein to God. Veryearly on in the process he cautioned the studio against pursuing thisobvious analogy. ``Throughout the script there are a number ofreferences to Frankenstein ... which compare him to God and whichcompare his creation of the monster to God's creation of man.'' HereBreen was blunt: ``All such references should be deleted'' (Gardner66). The subject matter was too tied to the comparison for such anultimatum to be completely followed, however, and a back-and-forthon the topic went on throughout the production process. In one sceneof the shooting script Frankenstein intensely monologues: ``I couldhave bred a race and have found perhaps the secret of eternal life.All that was in my brain -- my very grasp. I conceived it -- it waslike being God!'' (Riley B-7) Predictably, Joe Breen was not amused.He suggested omitting the line, saying that it had in the past ``provensomewhat blasphemous'' (Gardner 67). Whaler responded by offeringto refer to ``being the Creator'' instead, but in the end theoffered proved moot as the entire line was cut from the theatricalprint. Later in the sequence Dr. Pretorius was to derisively tellFrankenstein to ``follow the lead of Nature ... or of God -- ifyou are fond of your fairy tales'' (Riley B-26). Breen wanted theline cut; Whaler instead changed ``fairy tales'' to ``Biblestories.'' </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="26" __label="true"> Another religiously oriented cut provides a good example of the wayin which Code-required cuts could alter the attitude of a scene. Whilerunning from a pursuing mob Frankenstein's monster happens into acemetery. The script called for the monster to happen upon an ``imposingmonument'' depicting Christ on the cross (F-8). The monster, in ashow of compassion, tries to help the stricken figure, thinking itto be a human mistreated as he has been. The monster's effort endsup toppling the monument, revealing the crypt entrance below. Breenobjected to the scene, saying that Whaler ``should omit the figureof the statue of the Christ from this scene, substituting some othertype of monument'' (Gardner 67). Changing the monument, however,changes how the audience views the monster's actions. Instead of attemptingto be compassionate, the monster is instead shown lashing out at arandom statue, toppling it in an act that is far more aggressive thanthe original was to be. Though Breen meant only to prevent a conservativepublic from finding offense in the scene, the effect of his actionwas to force upon the monster an entirely different motivation. </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="27" __label="true"> Aside from depictions of religion, Breen was primarily concerned withthe gruesomeness and violence the film promised. Even after primaryshooting had ended Breen wrote to Universal warning them that thefilm would not get its seal as it then stood. ``This picture seemsto us definitely to be a violation of our Production Code,'' he wrotethem, ``because of its excessive brutality and gruesomeness''(69). Scenes already filmed were targeted for removal. Early in thefilm a man and his wife are left standing by the burning wreckageof the mill as the crowd that watched the monster destroyed wandersoff. The man moves closer, wanting his eyes to confirm for him thatthe monster was truly dead. Instead the man falls into the water belowand comes face-to-face with a monster very much alive. The man iskilled, and as the monster crawls up to the surface the wife is broughtto a similar fate. The script gave a scene in which the drama betweenmonster and man unfolded slowly; Breen wanted the man's drowning togo unshown. He also wanted deleted the shot of the monster pullingthe wife into the water. He won one and lost one, as Universal cutthe drowning scene but kept the image of the wife being tossed toher death. Later there is a scene where the monster kills a smallgirl. This body is viewed by a group of ``little girls coming outof church in their white dresses'' and later carried through thestreets by the mother. The final print of the film still containedthe shot of the girls viewing the off-camera body, but cut the onethat would have shown the body itself (69). </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="28" __label="true"> Breen was concerned not just with visuals that might upset the public,but dialogue choices as well. The opening shots of the film originallyincluded a scene where Mary Shelley says that she, her poet husband,and Lord Byron are ``all three infidels, scoffers at all marriageties, believing only in living fully and freely in whatever directionthe heart dictates'' (Riley A-5). The line, along with most of thosemeant for these three, was cut completely from the theatrical print.Elsewhere Breen got detailed enough to be squirmish about the word``entrails,'' getting it replaced with ``insides.'' (Gardner67-68). Breen also took objection to the idea of the monster as asexual creature. Reviewing an early script he wrote that ``themonster's use of the word ``mate'' should be dropped in this scene.All material which suggests he desires a sexual companion is objectionable.We suggest you substitute the word ``companion'''' (66). In theend the monster does refer to his soon-to-be-created partner as a``wife,'' though whether this implies more or less of a sexualconnotation than mate is debatable (Riley F-16). </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="29" __label="true"> Only a few of the scenes censored in </span> 
      <i> <span __num="30" __label="true"> Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="31" __label="true"> involved sexuality. In the scene where Dr. Pretorius shows Frankensteinhis created miniature creatures, one of the jars contains a tiny mermaid.Breen wrote that, ``The scene of the miniature mermaid should behandled in such a way as to avoid any improper exposure'' (Gardner67). The shooting script made gave no guidance on what the mermaidshould look like, but the final release made sure the mermaid waswell-clothed. Cut entirely from the film were scenes in which MaryShelley was considered to be showing too much of her breasts. Breen'smemo after photography had finished tersely demanded that the studio``Delete all the ``breast shots'' in Reel 1'' (69). Theseshots went, and their late removal might have been part of the reasonso much of the dialogue from these scenes was gutted. </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="32" __label="true"> The ending of the film was also changed after primary shooting hadended, though in this case changes were due more to Universal's concernthat the film have a happy ending than to any censorship concerns.Where the shooting script has Frankenstein and Elizabeth dying alongsidethe Doctor and their almost-human creations, the final theatricalprint does not. The principals were brought back to reshoot an endingin which the monster allows Frankenstein and Elizabeth to leave thetower before its destruction. However refilming the entire sequencewas too costly and in the final shot before the tower is destroyedFrankenstein is seen still inside, even though just previously hehad been shown to leave. </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="33" __label="true"> In the end Breen gave </span> 
      <i> <span __num="34" __label="true"> Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="35" __label="true"> a seal despitethe fact that it had not addressed all the objections he had raised.Just because the Production Code Administration signed off on thefilm did not mean the rest of the way was smooth sailing, though.Breen warned Universal to expect trouble with other censoring agencies: </span> 
      <blockquote> 
       <span __num="36" __label="true"> It is more than likely that this picture will meet with considerablydifficulty at the hands of [state and local] censor boards bothin this country and abroad. The nature of the production is such asto invite very critical examination on the part of these censor boards,and you may well expect difficulty with it wherever the picture isshown (71). </span> 
      </blockquote> 
      <span __num="37" __label="true"> Breen's warning proved to be absolutely correct. A few states didmake cuts to the film, but primarily trouble came when the productionwas shown abroad. The film was gutted in several countries and bannedoutright in a few others. </span> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <span __num="38" __label="true"> Despite its censorship troubles, Bride of Frankenstein was an enormousfiscal success. Audiences were able to look past the plot holes introducedby the many minutes of footage cut after filming and find a compellinghorror film. Today many of Breen's cuts look petty and the remainingcontent entirely tame, but to the audience of the time this was anamazing film. The Production Code Administration greatly affectedthe cinema of its time, and in </span> 
      <i> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Bride of Frankenstein </span> </i> 
      <span __num="40" __label="true"> youcan see how the required changes altered the tone and character ofthe film. </span>
