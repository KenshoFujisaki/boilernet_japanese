Combing his fingers throughthe tangled shag on her neck, he whispers to me, in the darkness, “Thesehere are witches’ tails, these tangles. They’re from when the witches ride‘em at night.

   <font color="#000000"> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Certain wildlife officialsand sport hunters have claimed the wild horses of Western Canada are merelyferal -&nbsp; just&nbsp; runaway packing horses from old logging and miningcamps. </span> </font> 
   <br> 
   <font color="#000000"> <span __num="43" __label="true"> But Davis’s lean, scruffyponies of the foothills are indeed the true item. His mustangs are thetough, rough mares and stallions of legendary Indian days, not at all likethe bovine scrags&nbsp; commonly called “mustangs” by some. </span> </font> 
   <br> 
   <font color="#000000"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Unfortunately, Alberta’spopulation of feral&nbsp; runaway horses hogs the public attention&nbsp;that ought to go to the real mustangs. Most notably, the runaways roamingthe fenced-in grasslands of CFB Suffield,&nbsp; northwest of Calgary, havebeen made famous by highly publicized protests over a 1988&nbsp; roundup.Protestors mistakenly called the heavy Suffield horses mustangs. In fact,&nbsp;the feral horses of Suffield, with their mixed Shire,&nbsp; Suffolk andClydesdale bloodline, are no more mustangs&nbsp; than Old Bessie. Theirclaim on Western heritage is dubious. </span> </font>

He has been their advocate for decades,&nbsp; havingbeen instrumental in persuading the Alberta government in 1974 to stopissuing seasonal licences to hunt them. Still, he says, “It’s somethingterrible what they’ve done to them horses. There’s not too many left. They’vebeen hunted and chased, and killed. They’re scattered and gone.” Nobodyseems to care about the mustangs, says Davis, including even the HumaneSociety, who, he says, should do something about the condition in whichhorses often arrive at auction houses. They’re too often delivered to auctionbleeding, crippled, and blinded by&nbsp; their frantic struggling againstthe leg snares hunters use to trap them, says Davis. </span> </font>

   <br> 
   <font color="#000000"> <span __num="47" __label="true"> In 1920,&nbsp; Slim firstencountered the wild ponies.

The&nbsp; horse alternatelyappears and disappears from the fossil record at about one million yearintervals. All trace of&nbsp; the horse is lost by about 25,000 years ago.The species was unknown to the American continent when&nbsp; Columbus sailedfrom Spain on his voyage of discovery. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="57" __label="true"> But&nbsp; historians say thatColumbus , and even the subsequent Spanish explorers, Coronado and DeSoto,&nbsp;couldn’t themselves have reintroduced the&nbsp; lost species to North America.They argue that, although the earliest Spanish explorers did indeed bringhorses with them to the New World, they brought only limited&nbsp; numbersof the animals, and very few of those were mares.&nbsp; Coronado, for example,&nbsp;wrote in his diary that he had brought “five&nbsp; hundred and fifty-eighthorses, two of them mares.” Two mares could hardly have stocked the whole&nbsp;continent,&nbsp; say historians. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="58" __label="true"> More likely sources for theNorth American population of ponies, say historians, were stock-raisingranches established by the Spanish in the Santa Fe area between the 1550sand the 1700s. The ranches furnished ideal conditions for the spread ofhorses to the rest of the continent : friendly contact with the Indiansthrough trade, an ample supply of horses, and plenty of opportunities forthe Indians to study possible uses for the new creature. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="59" __label="true"> Logically, the movement ofhorses into the North Americas would have followed established&nbsp; inter-tribal trade routes. From Spanish records we know that, beginning around1600, southwest tribes such as the Utes, Comanches, Apaches and Kiowasbegan raiding the Spanish ranches and stealing large numbers of horses.From those&nbsp; tribes, the horses slowly spread across the continent.La Verendrye reported that tribes living northeast of the&nbsp; Black Hillsin Montana had no horses when he visited them in 1738. Yet just 16 yearslater in 1754 Anthony Henday, the Hudson’s Bay Company explorer, met Assiniboinesin the same area who had horses, though they used them only for packing,not for riding. By 1766 Henday reported numerous Assiniboines now skillfullyriding the horses. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="60" __label="true"> Several Indian tribes haveoral traditions chronicling their first acquisition of horses : Tetonssay they got theirs from the Arikaras; Shoshonis from Comanches, and NezPerces from Shoshonis. </span> </font> <br> <a name="In 1827 an American trader, Robert Meldrum, reported that old Crow people told him their generation was the  first generation of"> </a> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="61" __label="true"> In1827 an American trader, Robert Meldrum, reported that old Crow peopletold him their generation was the&nbsp; first generation of Crows to seehorses. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="62" __label="true"> So it was that the hardy Spanishponies gradually populated the North American continent, as possessionsof the native peoples. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="63" __label="true"> Wild herds of escapees werereported by the late 1800s, though they were mostly ignored by the Indians,as&nbsp; domestic ponies were plentiful and easier to handle. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Eventually horse- stealingbecame the foremost means to&nbsp; acquire more horses, and full blown“horse culture” was in full swing among the Indian tribes by the end ofthe century. The “Indian pony” - small, squat&nbsp; and&nbsp; tough -&nbsp;became the mainstay of Indian life, indispensable in transport, warfare,leisure, hunting, religion and trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it waspractically inevitable that Indians began to measure wealth by the numberof horses a man owned.

Canadian Piegans rode down out of the Calgary area to the PryorCreek area of northern Montana. They made off with 60 horses stolen fromthe Crows camped there. To this day a mysterious herd of wild horses isknown to exist in the Pryor Mountain area.

Frantic, the horses were&nbsp; loaded into waitingtrucks for transport to auction or slaughterhouses. Many would arrive atthe slaughterhouse&nbsp; already dead, trampled to death in transit.

He wrotein his diary&nbsp; while crossing the West that wild horses froze as if&nbsp;paralyzed when his men merely “shouted a halloa” and dashed at them. Hewas only the first of many horse&nbsp; runners to report the phenomenon.Modern hunters still&nbsp; observe that stallions, in particular, commonlyseem&nbsp; unable to survive the ordeal of being captured and will&nbsp;to die within hours or days of being deprived of their&nbsp; freedom.

The only part you might have doubtabout is the&nbsp; loading of the frightened animals onto trucks.”&nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp; the dive-bombing bloodbaths were brought to an endin 1959. Forest conservation officials felt pressured&nbsp; by&nbsp; publiccries for more compassionate treatment of&nbsp; the mustangs, and, magnanimously,decreed that roundup by cattle horse, not by dive-bombers,&nbsp; was theonly humane way to go. </span> </font> <br> <a name="The numbers of  mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century"> </a> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="82" __label="true"> Thenumbers of&nbsp; mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century.&nbsp;A 1895 police census showed 42,257 wild horses on the range in SouthernAlberta. In 1958 a roundup expert said huge tracts of Alberta land carriedvast wild horse herds. “The whole place is a wild horse kingdom,” saidChester Utter in a report in The Albertan newspaper in August, 1958. Utterboasted that he alone had rounded up more than 40,000 horses. One yearlater, in 1959, the Calgary Herald carried a front-page story saying thehorses were “facing extinction.” The next year, 1960, the Alberta Cattlemen’sAssociation said there were some 3,000 still roaming at will. By 1977,The Herald thought that about 1,000 head of wild horses roamed the foothills.In 1991 Alberta Fish and Wildlife counted 300 mustangs roaming free inKananaskis Country. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="83" __label="true"> In 1974, Calgary Socred MLAArt Dixon agreed with&nbsp; the mid-70s figure of “about 1,000”, but arguedthat if&nbsp; the annual hunt continued the horses would soon be wiped&nbsp;out. Spurred on by Slim Davis and the thousands of names he had collectedon a petition, Dixon successfully lobbied the Alberta legislature to&nbsp;stop the regular issuing of hunting permits for wild horses. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="84" __label="true"> With this regulatory movein 1974, horses roaming on&nbsp; Crown lands in Alberta could no longerbe legally hunted. But horses straying onto private lands were, and stillare,&nbsp; treated&nbsp; as fair game for hunters, in season year- round. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="85" __label="true"> A private members’ bill passedby the Klein government in 1993 making the capture of horses on publicland more&nbsp; than just a minor regulatory infraction&nbsp; merely re-jigsthe 1974 regulation. Mustangs that make the horrible mistake of strayingonto private property are still legal prey for hunters in Alberta. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="86" __label="true"> In B.C., in 1988 the Vancouver Sunreported three herds of&nbsp; mustangs ranging the Chilcotin district .The largest of the herds, the Red Brush herd, numbered 150.

Rejects from domesticherds, she argues, would never have survived over the years under&nbsp;such conditions. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="90" __label="true"> “It was the animal thatwas originally&nbsp; the most ‘Western’ that survived the harsh test ofthe&nbsp; wild. The big, slow gentle farm horses and the high - strung,grain-fed horses were not creatures that could&nbsp; easily adapt to bleakhabitats and rugged winters,” wrote Ryden. </span> </font> <br> <font color="#000000"> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Ryden further warranted thepurity of the mustang pedigree based on the fact that there has been nogenetic&nbsp; break in the continuity of the wild horse bloodline fromthe last century to this century. Since&nbsp; the West was opened, shepointed out, though the total&nbsp; number of wild horses has dwindleddrastically the wild&nbsp; horse population did not at any time vanish.Therefore, she said, the mustang bloodline&nbsp; extends perfectly fromthe 16th century to present day. From Columbus to Slim Davis’s mare - oneunbroken genetic heritage. </span> </font> </p>
