But this is not very helpful, for the same may be said about almost everything in the field of modern human resources management. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="19" __label="true"> As a distinct and formal management procedure used in the evaluation of work performance, appraisal really dates from the time of the Second World War - not more than 60 years ago. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="20" __label="true"> Yet in a broader sense, the practice of appraisal is a very ancient art. In the scale of things historical, it might well lay claim to being the world's second oldest profession! </span> <br> <br> <span __num="21" __label="true"> There is, says </span> <a href="dulewicz.htm"> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Dulewicz (1989) </span> </a> <span __num="23" __label="true"> , "... a basic human tendency to make judgements about those one is working with, as well as about oneself." Appraisal, it seems, is both inevitable and universal. In the absence of a carefully structured system of appraisal, people will tend to judge the work performance of others, including subordinates, naturally, informally and arbitrarily. </span> </font> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="24" __label="true"> The human inclination to judge can create serious motivational, ethical and legal problems in the workplace. Without a structured appraisal system, there is little chance of ensuring that the judgements made will be lawful, fair, defensible and accurate. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Performance appraisal systems began as simple methods of income justification. That is, appraisal was used to decide whether or not the salary or wage of an individual employee was justified. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="26" __label="true"> The process was firmly linked to material outcomes. If an employee's performance was found to be less than ideal, a cut in pay would follow. On the other hand, if their performance was better than the supervisor expected, a pay rise was in order. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Little consideration, if any, was given to the developmental possibilities of appraisal. If was felt that a cut in pay, or a rise, should provide the only required impetus for an employee to either improve or continue to perform well. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Sometimes this basic system succeeded in getting the results that were intended; but more often than not, it failed. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="29" __label="true"> For example, early motivational researchers were aware that different people with roughly equal work abilities could be paid the same amount of money and yet have quite different levels of motivation and performance. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="30" __label="true"> These observations were confirmed in empirical studies. Pay rates were important, yes; but they were not the only element that had an impact on employee performance. It was found that other issues, such as morale and self-esteem, could also have a major influence. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="31" __label="true"> As a result, the traditional emphasis on reward outcomes was progressively rejected. In the 1950s in the United States, the potential usefulness of appraisal as tool for motivation and development was gradually recognized. The general model of performance appraisal, as it is known today, began from that time. </span> <br> <br> <img align="middle" height="6" src="BULLET.GIF" width="6"> <b> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Modern Appraisal </span> <br> </b> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Performance appraisal may be defined as a structured formal interaction between a subordinate and supervisor, that usually takes the form of a periodic interview (annual or semi-annual), in which the work performance of the subordinate is examined and discussed, with a view to identifying weaknesses and strengths as well as opportunities for improvement and skills development. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="34" __label="true"> In many organizations - but not all - appraisal results are used, either directly or indirectly, to help determine reward outcomes. That is, the appraisal results are used to identify the better performing employees who should get the majority of available merit pay increases, bonuses, and promotions. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="35" __label="true"> By the same token, appraisal results are used to identify the poorer performers who may require some form of counseling, or in extreme cases, demotion, dismissal or decreases in pay. (Organizations need to be aware of laws in their country that might restrict their capacity to dismiss employees or decrease pay.) </span> <br> <br> <span __num="36" __label="true"> Whether this is an appropriate use of performance appraisal - the assignment and justification of rewards and penalties - is a very uncertain and contentious matter. </span> <br> <br> <img align="middle" height="6" src="BULLET.GIF" width="6"> <b> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Controversy, Controversy </span> <br> </b> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Few issues in management stir up more controversy than performance appraisal. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="39" __label="true"> There are many reputable sources - researchers, management commentators, psychometricians - who have expressed doubts about the validity and reliability of the performance appraisal process. Some have even suggested that the process is so inherently flawed that it may be impossible to perfect it (see </span> <a href="derven1.htm"> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Derven, 1990 </span> </a> <span __num="41" __label="true"> , for example). </span> <br> <br> <span __num="42" __label="true"> At the other extreme, there are many strong advocates of performance appraisal. Some view it as potentially "... the most crucial aspect of organizational life" ( </span> <a href="lawrie1.htm"> <span __num="43" __label="true"> Lawrie, 1990 </span> </a> <span __num="44" __label="true"> ). </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Between these two extremes lie various schools of belief. While all endorse the use of performance appraisal, there are many different opinions on how and when to apply it. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="46" __label="true"> There are those, for instance, who believe that performance appraisal has many important employee development uses, but scorn any attempt to link the process to reward outcomes - such as pay rises and promotions. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="47" __label="true"> This group believes that the linkage to reward outcomes reduces or eliminates the developmental value of appraisals. Rather than an opportunity for constructive review and encouragement, the reward-linked process is perceived as judgmental, punitive and harrowing. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="48" __label="true"> For example, how many people would gladly admit their work problems if, at the same time, they knew that their next pay rise or a much-wanted promotion was riding on an appraisal result? Very likely, in that situation, many people would deny or downplay their weaknesses. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Nor is the desire to distort or deny the truth confined to the person being appraised. Many appraisers feel uncomfortable with the combined role of judge and executioner. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="50" __label="true"> Such reluctance is not difficult to understand. Appraisers often know their appraisees well, and are typically in a direct subordinate-supervisor relationship. They work together on a daily basis and may, at times, mix socially. Suggesting that a subordinate needs to brush up on certain work skills is one thing; giving an appraisal result that has the direct effect of negating a promotion is another. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="51" __label="true"> The result can be resentment and serious morale damage, leading to workplace disruption, soured relationships and productivity declines. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="52" __label="true"> On the other hand, there is a strong rival argument which claims that performance appraisal must unequivocally be linked to reward outcomes. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="53" __label="true"> The advocates of this approach say that organizations must have a process by which rewards - which are not an unlimited resource - may be openly and fairly distributed to those most deserving on the basis of merit, effort and results. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="54" __label="true"> There is a critical need for remunerative justice in organizations. Performance appraisal - whatever its practical flaws - is the only process available to help achieve fair, decent and consistent reward outcomes. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="55" __label="true"> It has also been claimed that appraisees themselves are inclined to believe that appraisal results should be linked directly to reward outcomes - and are suspicious and disappointed when told this is not the case. Rather than feeling relieved, appraisees may suspect that they are not being told the whole truth, or that the appraisal process is a sham and waste of time. </span> <br> <br> <img align="middle" height="6" src="BULLET.GIF" width="6"> <b> <span __num="56" __label="true"> The Link to Rewards </span> <br> </b> <span __num="57" __label="true"> Recent research ( </span> <a href="bannist.htm"> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Bannister &amp; Balkin, 1990) </span> </a> <span __num="59" __label="true"> has reported that appraisees seem to have greater acceptance of the appraisal process, and feel more satisfied with it, when the process is directly linked to rewards. Such findings are a serious challenge to those who feel that appraisal results and reward outcomes must be strictly isolated from each other. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="60" __label="true"> There is also a group who argues that the evaluation of employees for reward purposes, and frank communication with them about their performance, are part of the basic responsibilities of management. The practice of not discussing reward issues while appraising performance is, say critics, based on inconsistent and muddled ideas of motivation. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <span __num="61" __label="true"> In many organizations, this inconsistency is aggravated by the practice of having separate wage and salary reviews, in which merit rises and bonuses are decided arbitrarily, and often secretly, by supervisors and managers. </span> <br> <br> <br> </font> </p> <p align="center"> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva" size="2"> <br> </font> <font face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> <small> <small> <a href="home.htm#intro"> <span __num="62"> Back </span> </a> <span __num="63"> | </span> <a href="home.htm"> <span __num="64"> Home </span> </a> <span __num="65"> | </span> <a href="mailto:help@performance-appraisal.com"> <span __num="66"> Email </span> </a> <span __num="67"> | </span> <a href="fax.htm"> <span __num="68"> Fax </span> </a> <span __num="69"> | </span> <a href="postal.htm"> <span __num="70"> Postal </span> </a> <span __num="71"> | </span> <a href="#top"> <span __num="72"> Top </span> </a> <span __num="73"> | </span> <br> <br> <br> <span __num="74" __label="true"> See </span> <a href="licence.htm"> <span __num="75" __label="true"> License Information </span> </a> <span __num="76" __label="true"> to become a user of the </span> <br> <span __num="77" __label="true"> Archer North Performance Appraisal System </span> <br> <br> <img height="29" src="COPYRITE.GIF" width="220"> </small> </small> </font> </p> </td>
