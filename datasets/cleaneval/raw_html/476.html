While I waited for my friend Deb to arrive at the alley, I checked out its video games--and found that one of them was </span> <em> <span __num="9" __label="true"> The Act </span> </em> <span __num="10" __label="true"> , an "interactive romantic comedy" which I'd read about on </span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlepin_bowling"> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Cartoon Brew </span> </a> <span __num="12" __label="true"> earlier this year. </span> </p> <p> <em> <span __num="13" __label="true"> The Act </span> </em> <span __num="14" __label="true"> is tough to describe, but virtually every reference I've seen to it brings up Don Bluth's </span> <em> <span __num="15" __label="true"> Dragon's Lair </span> </em> <span __num="16" __label="true"> , and that's as good a frame of reference as any, although this new game is vastly more interesting than the Bluth one. It's an arcade game done in full character animation--amazingly, maybe the first since those Bluth laserdisc games of the 1980s, even though the technology is far more practical these days. But while the Bluth games' themes were pretty much exactly the same as other early arcade games, </span> <em> <span __num="17" __label="true"> The Act </span> </em> <span __num="18" __label="true"> is indeed a romantic comedy, involving a klutzy window washer, a sexy nurse, an unpleasant boss, and other characters. I'm not sure if the parallels are intentional, but it reminds me a lot of a Harold Lloyd film. (In part because there's no dialog--or at least I didn't hear any during the section of the game I was able to get through before losing.) </span> </p> <p> <em> <span __num="19" __label="true"> Dragon's Lair </span> </em> <span __num="20" __label="true"> was a game with a simple input device (a joystick) and game play that was almost beside the point (you thrashed the joystick around, but it didn't seem to have that much impact on what happened). </span> <em> <span __num="21" __label="true"> The Act </span> </em> <span __num="22" __label="true"> has an even simpler input device (a rotating knob, not unlike the one from Pong), but the game play is surprisingly subtle. Basically, you rotate the knob to control the hero's behavior, and the idea is to keep him active without forcing him to go over the top. So in the first bit of game play, in which he's flirting with the nurse in a </span> <em> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Casablanca </span> </em> <span __num="24" __label="true"> parody, you've got to turn the knob with a lot of finesse--rather slowly, precisely, and sporadically--to avoid scaring her off. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Between the nicely-done animation, unusual premise, and unique game play, I found the game pretty absorbing, and was playing when Deb arrived. She was intrigued, but when I asked her if she wanted to have a go, she said "No!" I should have asked her why, but didn't. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> Back at my folks' house, I looked into the story behind </span> <em> <span __num="27" __label="true"> The Act </span> </em> <span __num="28" __label="true"> , and found that I'd lucked into being one of the first people to play it. It's the product of a Boston-area company called </span> <a href="http://www.cecropia.com/"> <span __num="29" __label="true"> Cecropia </span> </a> <span __num="30" __label="true"> , and is in a test rollout at seven Massachusetts and New Hampshire locations through January, including the bowling alley we'd gone to. The animation, directed by Broose Johnson, was done by laid-off veterans of Disney's Orlando studio, and it's good, funny stuff; even the backgrounds are well done. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> (The Cecropia site has </span> <a href="http://www.cecropia.com/news/TorontoStar06.09.28.shtml"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> more background on the game </span> </a> <span __num="33" __label="true"> .) </span> </p> <p> <em> <span __num="34" __label="true"> The Act </span> </em> <span __num="35" __label="true"> has almost nothing to do with the barely-alive industry that arcade gaming has become--it's low-key, free of violence other than the slapstick kind, and rewards restraint on the part of the game player. Most players of arcade games--who seem to be a pretty lonely bunch of pre-teen boys these days--probably wouldn't like it; most people who might like it probably haven't played an arcade game in years. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> I have no idea whether it stands a chance as a business enterprise, but I hope so--it's a new idea, and one which makes excellent use of hand-drawn animation.

If anyone's reading this, I may find out. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> At MGM in the 1940s, Joe Barbera and Bill Hanna made some of the funniest, most expressive, most </span> <em> <span __num="46" __label="true"> alive </span> </em> <span __num="47" __label="true"> short films--of any sort--ever produced anywhere. If they'd left the business when the studio's cartoon arm closed in 1957, I'm convinced, their reputation today would be pretty simple to summarize: Everyone would know that they were grand masters of the American animated short, period. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> But Bill and Joe went on to found their own studio, one whose yearly output dwarfed their entire MGM career. And it produced...well, mostly cynical crud. (For years, my attitude towards the early Huck Hound and Yogi Bear shorts was almost entirely dispassionate, perhaps because we got them on Portland TV only when I was about nine and had already been soured on HB from watching too much of its later output; recently, I've come to appreciate them for their voicework, design, and, in some cases, writing. But I'd still rather watch almost any Jay Ward cartoon from the same era.) </span> </p> <p> <span __num="49" __label="true"> From the start, the HB studio's work was derivative--Ruff and Reddy being clones of Crusader Rabbit and Rags--and by the mid-1960s, most of it was derivative junk without the saving graces of the early stuff. HB has been called the studio that saved the animation business, but to borrow a phrase from a war of that era, it had to destroy the artform in order to save it. I still wonder if TV animation would have gotten so bad so quickly if Hanna-Barbera hadn't defined schlockiness down a little more each season for so long. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> And it was all doubly depressing because Hanna and Barbera had proved themselves capable of making wonderful cartoons. For all we know, Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott were capable only of swill; Bill and Joe didn't have that excuse. I remain convinced that they could have done better. Even with the budgets they had. Even in an era in which the networks made it almost impossible to produce a good TV cartoon. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> (Question: Is it pure coincidence that when HB utterly dominated the industry, nearly all television animation was abysmal--and when the company's fortunes took a turn for the worse, in the late 1980s or so, the quality of the average TV cartoon improved sharply? Discuss...) </span> </p> <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> (Another question: If Daws Butler had never lived, would anyone remember the earliest HB cartoons with even a small fraction of the fondness they generate today?) </span> </p> <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> Pardon me--I think I'll go off now and watch </span> <em> <span __num="54" __label="true"> The Zoot Cat </span> </em> <span __num="55" __label="true"> ... </span> </p> </font> </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> <br> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> <span __num="56"> Posted by Harry on </span> </font> <font size="1"> <span __num="57"> December 19, 2006 6:25 AM </span> <a href="http://www.harrymccracken.com/blog/archives/2006/12/joe_barbera_1911_2006.html"> <span __num="58"> Comments: 6 </span> </a> </font> <br> <br> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <a href="http://www.harrymccracken.com/blog/archives/2006/11/the_returnslowly_but_surelyof.html"> <strong> <span __num="59"> The Return--Slowly But Surely--of Harry-Go-Round </span> </strong> </a> </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br> <font size="2"> <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> When I celebrated Friz Freleng's birthday here back in August, I really didn't intend to go for close to three months without blogging.

And they said that one of the biggest challenges with the con has become the fact that all the companies involved in the most popular panels are insistent that they be held on Saturday--which is at least one reason why that day has become the most frustrating, least pleasurable one of the convention, at least for me.

I haven't heard any word on attendance, but I seem to have spent more time than ever more or less trapped in show-floor traffic that's just not going anywhere. One panel I wanted to go to--not obviously a huge crowd-pleaser--was turning people away by the time I got there; the line for the </span> <em> <span __num="145" __label="true"> Simpsons </span> </em> <span __num="146" __label="true"> panel was so long that it was half over by the time I got into the room. I've also been barked at twice by con representatives for trying to jump lines when I was simply trying to use hallways to get from one place to another. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="147" __label="true"> Part of the problem, I think, is that this convention isn't </span> <em> <span __num="148" __label="true"> about </span> </em> <span __num="149" __label="true"> anything, other than the vague notion of "a celebration of the popular arts." Not being about anything, it's about everything, including comics, animation, fantasy movies, horror, science fiction, costume-making, toys, role-playing games, computer games, and myriad other topics. I didn't see any scheduled events about tattoos, but judging from some of the attendees this year, the showing off of elaborate tattoos has become another theme of this show. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="150" __label="true"> Conventions, like magazines, need to be edited. Most of the best comics conventions I've ever attended had a clear sensibility at work--often that of a single person, such as the old New York cons' Phil Seuling, or Don Phelps, the proprietor of some amazing conventions in Boston in the 1970s. If there's a sensibility at work in the San Diego programming, I can't detect it. And while it may be a celebration of the popular arts, it's anything but a celebration of excellence--over and over, the programming booklet applies the same superlatives to anything and everything. </span> <em> <span __num="151" __label="true"> Veronica Mars </span> </em> <span __num="152" __label="true"> is memorable. Shag has entered the pop culture pantheon. Gumby is magical. David Boreanaz is one of TV's biggest stars. A blurb on a session about Pokemon season 9 uses two exclamation points (!!). And so on. There's no editing going on, and that, I'm sure, is one reason why the con is so huge. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="153" __label="true"> Oh, and would someone inform the management of the San Diego Convention Center that convention-center food can consist of more than ludicrously overpriced pretzels and cookies served at understaffed counters with nowhere to sit? I spend a lot of time in major convention centers as part of my day job; I don't know of another whose food service is as bad as what we get in this otherwise lovely , highly functional city. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="154" __label="true"> I'm not sure if there's any way to change San Diego into something other than what it's become, and to be fair, the people who run it do a mostly good job of crowd control and attendees are generally respectful of each other. But this is the first year I've said to myself, "Gee, I'm not sure if this'll be worth the hassle next year." </span> <br> <br>

I've been to some good panels, including a Jerry Robinson one hosted by Mark Evanier, an Alex Toth tribute, one on Dan DeCarlo (an artist who, I discovered for the first time, I admired), and Jerry Beck's Worst Cartoons Ever, which included not one but two Sam Singer cartoons I'd never seen.
