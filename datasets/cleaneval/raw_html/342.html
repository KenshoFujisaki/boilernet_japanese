It will come with a modern MSI installer (allowingautomated installation and upgrades via Group Policy andorganization-specific customizations, e.g. packaging of custom Dialerentries, initialization files, and scripts). And since we won't besupporting Windows 95/98/ME any more, we should be able to put the Dialerback to using the convenient notebook tabs for its entries rather than thecurrent awkward "direct access" one-at-a-time method. We also expect thatthe next release of Kermit 95 will support large files (transfer, access,and management of files bigger than 2GB) and 64-bit integer arithmetic, andperhaps also a GUI dialog for file uploads.More about the next release </span> <a href="k95next.html"> <span __num="66" __label="true"> HERE </span> </a> <span __num="67" __label="true"> . </span> </p>
