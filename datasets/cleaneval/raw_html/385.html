Nearly 1,000 youngsters, most of whom are aged between 14 and 16, sail aboard the brig every year. </span> <br> <span __num="16" __label="true"> The ship, which takes kids on trips around the British Isles, started her journey at Inverness before making stopovers at Ardrossan and then on to her home port of Gosport. </span> <br> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Alan Burt, Secretary of the Square Rigger Club - which is a charity that helps provide bursaries for sea cadets participating on the voyage - commented on the scheme: “The chance to set sail aboard this magnificent ship is a fantastic experience for sea cadets from all over Britain. </span> <br> <span __num="18" __label="true"> “We provide finance and help supplement the permanent crew by providing volunteers to help out on the ship.

This ranges from household names like Walkers and Baxters to small, one man operations. </span> <br> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Maggie McGinlay, director of food and drink, Scottish Enterprise, said: “We are delighted that the spotlight is being put on Scottish food and drink by Harrods. </span> <br> <span __num="24" __label="true"> “Scotland produces a fantastic range of premium quality produce and the tempting array in-store will give food-lovers the chance to sample a selection of our splendid Scottish fare.” </span> <br> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Loch Fyne Oysters, which are based at Cairndow and partly owned by workers, have an annual turnover of £8 million. </span> <br> <span __num="26" __label="true"> Produce from Loch Fyne Oysters has made it to some of the most exclusive restaurants in the UK, as well as being featured on the menu list of GNER trains. </span> <br> <span __num="27" __label="true"> A spokesperson for Loch Fyne Oysters commented on their inclusion in the event, saying: “We are glad that we are being extensively recognised, as the west Highlands produce the best sea food in the UK.” </span> <br> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Harrods Chairman Mohamed Al Fayed considers Scotland to be his favourite holiday destination. </span> <br> <span __num="29" __label="true"> He added: “I have always had a special fondness for Scotland - its people are very agreeable, the countryside is spectacular and the history is rich and unique. </span> <br> <span __num="30" __label="true"> “Scotland has untold riches to offer, most especially as the producer of some of the finest foods in the United Kingdom.

Early signs include red blotches, flu-like symptoms and aching joints. </span> <br> <span __num="36" __label="true"> A spokesperson for the Scottish Tourist Board said: “In every tourist information centre in Scotland we supply anti-midge spray and cream for bugs such as ticks. </span> <br> <span __num="37" __label="true"> “We also advise all walkers who intend to walk in the countryside to use these products, as we are aware of the problems that have been associated with ticks.” </span> <br> <br> <br> </span> <span class="headline"> <span __num="38" __label="true"> EURO FESTIVAL </span> </span> <span class="para"> <br> <span __num="39" __label="true"> ON July 19 almost 1,000 participants converged in Schifflange, Luxembourg to take part in the week long annual European People’s Festival. Dunoon and Cowal, who represented the UK, sent a delegation of 56 participants to take part in sporting competitions, business exhibitions, culinary and culture presentations. </span> <br> <span __num="40" __label="true"> The Festival celebrations began on Sunday, July 20 with an Ecumenical Church Service, followed by a parade of all 14 participating nations through the streets of Schifflange. The Parade was a colourful event with each nation displaying their country’s flag and presenting impromptu cultural displays of dance and music. </span> <br> <span __num="41" __label="true"> Following speeches by Roland Hoferlin, President of the Luxembourg Team and Roland Schriener, Mayor of Schifflange, the EU Flag was raised to signify the opening of the Festival and mark the unity of the ‘People of Europe.’ </span> <br> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Sporting events began on Monday with handball and petanque. The Scottish delegation participated well in the handball competition with Allan Davidson (captain) directing a team who had no previous experience of this fast and exciting game. As expected, the Luxembourg team dominated this event taking first place with Scotland finishing a healthy 11th place. </span> <br> <span __num="43" __label="true"> The petanque team of Tony Black (captain) and Ricky and Nicky Reynolds fought hard in the petanque competition, playing against experienced European teams and much to their credit finished in a satisfying fifth place. </span> <br> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Tuesday’s sporting competitions were duathlon, football and badminton. Local badminton stars Gordon McKinven (captain), Paul Turner, Kirsty Turner and Christina English played superbly throughout the day’s competition winning all their games comfortably. However, when faced with old rivals Luxembourg in a fast and exhausting final they were edged out in a thrilling contest and took second place. The duathlon team of Adam MacKellar (captain), Elaine and Marie Caldwell and Anthony Andrews gave an excellent performance on a circuit which was tricky for both cyclists and runners. Luxembourg again dominated this event with the Cowal Europe team taking 13th place. </span> <br> <span __num="45" __label="true"> The football team managed by John Caldwell played some excellent games under very hot temperatures. Their games were vehemently fought and the team finished an encouraging eighth place. </span> <br> <span __num="46" __label="true"> On Tuesday evening the Scottish delegation presented to a packed hall their much acclaimed cultural presentation overseen by Cultural Convenor Allan Davidson. The show included performances by Dunoon’s local ceilidh band, ‘Canned Haggis,’ country and Highland dancers, pipers and drummers. The finale included an alternative Sword Dance to music from the Scottish band the ‘Proclaimers,’ which received a standing ovation by the European audience. </span> <br> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Thursday marked the end of the sporting competitions with tennis, basketball and shooting. The tennis team of Robert McGregor (captain), Lynn MacFarlane, Paul Turner and Christina English played in a series of singles and mixed doubles competitions. Their aim was to gain as many points as possible in a 20 minute tie-break. Again Luxembourg dominated this competition and Scotland finished in ninth place. </span> <br> <span __num="48" __label="true"> The basketball competition met with some unexpected complications, play being postponed due to some of the players being taller than the basket height, and new baskets having to be delivered and fitted! The Cowal Europe team, captained by Derek Henderson played well under very stiff competition and managed to gain a respectable tenth place. </span> <br> <span __num="49" __label="true"> The shooting competition proved to be an interesting experience, described by the Eurofestival reporters as a ‘meeting between friends in a loose atmosphere.’ The team of Alan Montgomery (captain), David Marshall and Kirsten Gibb displayed a high level of concentration in this new event and finished a reasonable 12th place in another Luxembourg dominated event. </span> <br> <span __num="50" __label="true"> From Sunday to Friday the business stands were open in the Town Hall Square. The Scottish stand managed by Pev McChlery, Ricky and Nicky Reynolds promoted Dunoon, Cowal and Argyll and Bute to enthralled Luxembourg inhabitants and festival participants. Home-made shortbread generously donated by the ‘Royal Marine Hotel’ was available for tasting along with a number of selected whiskies. Face painting by Karen Gibb, with an emphasis on Scottish culture, attracted many youngsters and parents to the stand. Amongst the distinguished guests who visited the Scottish Business Stand were the Swedish and Irish Ambassadors who came to support the European People’s Festival and experience the unity and the cultural diversity of the EU. RTL News covered the business stand arena and televised interviews with participants, organisers and guests. </span> <br> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Each day different countries presented culinary demonstrations in the business stand arena. On Thursday our cooks Margaret Montgomery and Margaret Caldwell, using Schifflange produce, prepared both trifle and cranachan desserts, eagerly devoured by a fascinated audience. </span> <br> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Friday brought to close a wonderful week with our European friends. Many friendships had been made and renewed. Fun events on this day included in-line skating, table tennis, wheelchair basketball demonstrations and chess (on giant chess boards). One thousand people attended the final dinner and presentations, and the European People’s Festival ended with a fantastic firework display. </span> <br> <span __num="53" __label="true"> The committee of Cowal Europe would like to thank Gordon Higgins; Canned Haggis Ceilidh Band; The Royal Marine Hotel; Dunoon Argyll Pipe Band; Ardentinny Hotel; Bob’s football programmes and Buchanan’s sweets. </span> <br> <span __num="54" __label="true"> In 2004 the European People’s Festival will be held in Upplands Vasby, Sweden. Adverts will be placed in the Dunoon Observer in December, and anyone interested in participating is encouraged to apply to the committee. </span> </span> </p> </td>
