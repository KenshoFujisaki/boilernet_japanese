        <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter is setting up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul Hatch: "We found that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect of the meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen book. Discourse then ran the full gambit of topics." </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first meeting will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two volunteers will take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the merits and pitfalls of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone else can add their spice to the debate on either side. </span> </p> 
        <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules. </span> <br> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner. </span> </p>
