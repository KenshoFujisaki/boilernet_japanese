       <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> In this passage, taken from his 1776 book"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"Adam Smith set out the mechanism by which he felt economic societyoperated. Each individual strives to become wealthy "intendingonly his own gain" but to this end he must exchange what heowns or produces with others who sufficiently value what he hasto offer; in this way, by division of labour and a free market,public interest is advanced. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Smith is often regarded as the father of economics, and his writingshave been enormously influential. Nowadays, "invisible hand" explanationsare invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena, from scientific progressto environmental degradation. In the modern context, mathematiciansstudy "invisible hand" processes as part of Game Theory, the branch ofmathematics that deals with payoffs and strategies (see </span> <a href="../../../issue13/features/brams/index.html"> <span __num="56" __label="true"> GameTheory and the Cuban Missile Crisis </span> </a> <span __num="57" __label="true"> )in Issue 13 of </span> <i> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Plus </span> </i> <span __num="59" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> Smith was profoundly religious, and saw the"invisible hand" as the mechanism by which a benevolent Godadministered a universe in which human happiness wasmaximised. He made it clear in his writings that quiteconsiderable structure was required in society before the invisible hand mechanism could work efficiently. For example,property rights must be strong, and there must be widespreadadherence to moral norms, such as prohibitions against theft andmisrepresentation. Theft was, to Smith, the worst crime of all,even though a poor man stealing from a rich man may increaseoverall happiness.He even went so far as to say that the purpose of governmentis to defend the rich from the poor. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates: </span> </p> 
       <p> </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> <span __num="62" __label="true"> There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in sucha way as to maximise human happiness. </span> </li> 
        <li> <span __num="63" __label="true"> In order to do this he has created humans with a naturethat leads them to act in a certain way. </span> </li> 
        <li> <span __num="64" __label="true"> The world as we know it is pretty much perfect, and everyone is about equally happy. In particular, the rich are no happier than the poor. </span> </li> 
        <li> <span __num="65" __label="true"> Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in life,our nature (which, remember, was created by God for the purposeof maximising happiness) leads us to think that we would behappier if we were wealthier. </span> </li> 
        <li> <span __num="66" __label="true"> This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become wealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness viathe mechanisms of exchange and division of labour. </span> </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for sucha system to work - in order for exchange to proceed, contracts must be enforceable, people must have goodaccess to information about the products and servicesavailable, and the rule of law must hold. </span> </p> 
       <p> </p> 
       <h2> <span __num="68" __label="true"> The modern "Invisible Hand" </span> </h2> 
       <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> Nowadays, something much more general is meant by the expression"invisible hand". An invisible hand process is one in whichthe outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised way,with no explicit agreements between theacting agents. The second essentialcomponent is that the process is not intentional. The agents' aimsare not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which isa byproduct of those aims. The process should work evenwithout the agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the processis called invisible. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumedto work is the free market. Adam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the lowest price,and that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of profit.He asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient demand known throughmarket prices, consumers "directed" entrepreneurs' investment money tothe most profitable industry. Remember that this is the industry producing the goods most highlyvalued by consumers, so in general economic well-being is increased. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="71" __label="true"> One extremely positive aspect of a market-basedeconomy is that it forces people to think about whatother people want. Smith saw this as a large part ofwhat was good about the invisible hand mechanism.He identified two ways to obtainthe help and co-operation of other people, upon which we all depend constantly.The first way is to appeal to the benevolence and goodwill of others. To do this a person must often act in a servile and fawning way, which Smithfound repulsive, and he claimed it generally meetswith very limited success. The second way is toappeal instead to other people's self-interest. In one of his most famous quotes: </span> </p> 
       <blockquote> 
        <i> <span __num="72" __label="true"> Man has almost constant occasion for the help of hisbrethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from theirbenevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he caninterest their self-love in his favour, and show them that it is fortheir own advantage to do for him what he requires of them.Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to dothis. Give me what I want, and you shall have this which you want, isthe meaning of every such offer; and it is the manner that weobtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices whichwe stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of thebutcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but fromtheir regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, notto their humanity but to their self-love. </span> </i> 
       </blockquote> 
       <p> <span __num="73" __label="true"> For Smith, to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that whatyou can do, or what you have, can be of use to the other. When you carryout the exchange, it means the other personrecognises that what you can do or that what youhave is of value. This is why so much of a person's self-esteem is bound upin their job - a well-paid job is supposed to be a sign that others value yourcontribution and find it worth exchanging their own resources for. </span> </p> 
       <p> </p>

       <p> <span __num="76" __label="true"> The theory of the invisible hand is certainly persuasive, and its simplicityis also very attractive. No doubt every reader can see that it describesthe way that things really work on many occasions, and, whether we find it palatable or not, we probably all recognise the truth of Smith's assertion that paying for your dinner is a more reliable way to get it thanappealing to the benevolence of others. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="77" __label="true"> But, even assuming all the correct conditions, does the invisible hand theoryreally lead to the maximisation of human economic wellbeingin some sense, as Smith asserts?This is where mathematics, in the form of Game Theory, can provide us withsome insights. </span> </p>

       <h3> <span __num="78" __label="true"> The Prisoner's Dilemma </span> </h3> 
       <p> <span __num="79" __label="true"> The "Prisoner's Dilemma" is a very famous "paradox" in Game Theory.It describes two people in a simple situation, acting in an informed manner,both attempting to maximisetheir wellbeing, and yet making choices that lead to an unnecessarily poor outcome for both. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="80" __label="true"> Two people, who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime, are held prisoner in separate, non-communicating cells.The police visit each prisoner, and tell both that if neither confesses, each will be sentenced to two years in jail.However, if exactly one prisoner confesses, implicating each other, the onewho confesses will get off scot-free as a reward, and the other, who didn't confess, will receive a punitive sentence of five years. If each confesses and implicates the other, both will be sentenced to three years. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="81" __label="true"> What should a prisoner in this situation do? Suppose that the other prisoner doesn'tconfess. Then the best course of action is to confess, and go free. Even if the other prisonerdoes confess, it will be better to have done likewise - at least the sentence will be lower.Both prisoners will reason thus, so both will confess andend up serving sentences of three years - eventhough, if both had remained silent, both would have served sentences of only two years. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="82" __label="true"> It may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner's Dilemmais to Smith's theory of the Invisible Hand. In fact, it has a number ofimplications for economic behaviour. </span> </p>

       <h4> <span __num="84" __label="true"> The temptation to default </span> </h4> 
       <p> <span __num="85" __label="true"> We can think of the prisoners as being asked to decidewhether to keep a contract they have made with each other(remain silent) or to default (confess and betray the other). Similar choices have to be made all the time in economic society.When two people freely agree to exchange goods or services to their mutual benefit, each mustdecide whether to try to cheat the other by defaulting, or handing over counterfeit goods,or whether to act in good faith and risk theother party defaulting. Obviously, both parties are better off if neither defaultthan if both default - after all, we suppose they willingly contracted with eachother - but each would like to getsomething for nothing, and each isafraid the other will feel the same. The result may well bethat the parties are unable to carry out the exchangeas arranged, and both lose out. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="86" __label="true"> The reason we don't see this behaviour too often is because we live in a society where courts can enforce contracts. This reduces the fear of the other party defaulting, and makes it easier to hand over goodsahead of receiving whatever is to be exchanged for them.In illegal exchanges, for example,receiving stolen goods, default is more common, and rather difficult for criminals to guard against. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="87" __label="true"> Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from someone else - in democratic societies, thecourts on behalf of the government and the people. But courts and prisons and police cost money and mostof the costs fall on people who were not party to the contract in the first place -who are therefore paying for a service that doesn't directly benefit themselves.Such courts fall into the category of "public good" - we are all better off in a societywhere the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained by any invisible hand mechanism.Courts are set up deliberately to carry out a public good; and, although they may not always workthe way they are intended to, there is nothing unintended about their use to enforcecontracts. </span> </p> 
       <p> </p> 
       <h4> <span __num="88" __label="true"> Subsidy-seeking </span> </h4> 
       <p> <span __num="89" __label="true"> In a democratic society, there is a strong temptationfor "special-interest" groups to form and lobby the government to provide tax-payers'money to the group in the form of subsidies. Politicians find the prospect of buying the loyalty of thegroup attractive, and the group sees the prospectof getting other people's money for nothing. Clearly, everyonewould be better off if no one sought subsidies - by definition,subsidies are only needed for unprofitable activities, that is,activities that other people do not value sufficientlyto pay their own money for. However,if other people seek and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn'tbother trying to do the same for themselveswill end up subsidising others while receiving no subsidiesthemselves. This fear may force large numbers of peopleto spend their time lobbying the government for subsidies, rather thansimply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic exampleof thePrisoner's Dilemma, and one over which no court has jurisdiction. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="90" __label="true"> A very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies.Since pretty much every producer is a consumer, it is probably to everybody's benefit overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by monopolising their market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be veryattractive to individual producers. Smith rather sardonically observed that </span> </p>

       <p> <span __num="93" __label="true"> As explained in the </span> <a href="../../../issue13/editorial/index.html#voting"> <span __num="94" __label="true"> Editorial </span> </a> <span __num="95" __label="true"> of Issue 13 of </span> <i> <span __num="96" __label="true"> Plus </span> </i> <span __num="97" __label="true"> , Arrow's Impossibility Theorem says that,in a certain sense, it is impossible to produce a consistent group preferenceby aggregating individual preferences.It is normally stated in terms of votes and elections,and, in this format, says that is impossible to use information about individualvoters' preferences to decide what is "the will of the people".Every voting system in current use throws up anomalies, suchas "flip-flops", which occur when a third candidate enters the race and overturnsthe group preference between the other two candidates (think ofRalph Nader in California, splitting Al Gore's vote and handing GeorgeBush the election). </span> </p> 
       <p> </p> 
       <h4> <span __num="98" __label="true"> The "will of the people" </span> </h4> 
       <p> <span __num="99" __label="true"> Again, the relevance to allocation of public goods is not immediatelyobvious - until you recall that an essential part of the invisiblehand process is that producers respond to an single signal that is meant to be an aggregate of all signalsby consumers. Arrow's Theorem is often interpreted assaying that there is no consistentway to aggregate the preferences of individuals to give a singlepreference which can be regarded as the preference of society -or "the will of the people". </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="100" __label="true"> An economic version of the flip-flop could occur if a majorityof customers would prefer to buy Product X to Product Y,but some of that majority actuallylike Product Z even better (the equivalent of splitting the vote); the producer may end up producingProduct Y even though more people would have liked Product X,and presumably it would have been more profitable to produce it.If this happens, then the invisible hand cannot be said to have worked to maximise economic wellbeing. </span> </p>

       <h2> <span __num="102" __label="true"> How far does the invisible hand reach? </span> </h2> 
       <p> <span __num="103" __label="true"> How economic systems work and what can be done to improve themis still very much a live area of research for economists.Mathematicians are currently grappling with the implications of game theory for all sorts of social choice, in particular, what meaning, if any,can be attached to the expressions "the will of the people" and"the public good". </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="104" __label="true"> The results of such analyses will not be the only factorin deciding whether societies move towards or awayfrom laissez-faire economics ("laissez-faire" means"let alone" and is shorthand for leaving things to theinvisible hand).Political will, whether the world becomes more peaceful or less,and the practicality of any alternatives will also be factors.Alternative systems tend to requiremuch more intervention and more stringent rules. In the real world, such rules automatically introduce more and more opportunities formistakes and corruption, which might mean that another system,even if better in principle, would be worse in practice. </span> </p> 
       <p> <span __num="105" __label="true"> Perhaps the strongest reason for leaving the allocationof effort and reward to the invisible hand is thatwhen it misappropriatesgoods, it is likely to beon a small scale. More centralised methods of allocatinggoods are more prone to corruption and waste. Smith describedpeople given the spending of other people's money thus: </span> </p> 
       <blockquote> 
        <i> <span __num="106" __label="true"> ..being the managers of other people's moneythan of their own, it cannot well be expectedthat they should watch over it with the sameanxious vigilance with which partners in aprivate copartnery frequently watch over theirown. Like the stewards of a rich man, they... consider attention to small matters asnot for their master's honour and very easilygive themselves a dispensation from having it. </span> </i> 
       </blockquote> 
       <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> It is useful to remember the context in whichSmith developed his theories - that of a heavily planned and ratherdictatorial society, where some individuals were above the lawand others were effectively without any rights. In a centralised societya few individuals make decisions on how to spend everyone's moneyand direct everyone's effort. As Smith said </span> </p> 
       <blockquote> 
        <i> <span __num="108" __label="true"> It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore,in kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of privatepeople, and to restrain their expense...They are themselves always, andwithout exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society. </span> </i>
