   <p align="left"> <span __num="1" __label="true"> Actually, the title is a little misleading; because you can't always win,but if you have good reasons for your appeal this information should help you present yourcase. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="2" __label="true"> The Board of Equalization was created by the Legislature to give citizensan opportunity to contest the Assessor's valuation of their property.&nbsp; However, theLegislature realized that counties get most of their revenue from property taxes, and ifit was easy to get the valuation reduced counties would soon run out of money.&nbsp; TheLegislature handled this by saying in effect "Ok, you have the right to appeal yourvaluation but we're going to make it an uphill battle for you to win." </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="3" __label="true"> The Legislature accomplished this by saying, "The Assessor'svaluation is assume to be correct.&nbsp; In order for the taxpayer to win his appeal hemust show by </span> <strong> <span __num="4" __label="true"> Clear, Cogent, and Convincing Reasoning </span> </strong> <span __num="5" __label="true"> that the Assessorhas made a mistake."&nbsp; Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence means a quantum ofproof which is less than beyond a reasonable doubt, but more than a mere preponderance ofthe evidence.&nbsp; It is the quantum of evidence necessary to convince the trier of factthat the ultimate fact in issue is "highly probably."&nbsp; Most Boards ofEqualization take this to mean that the taxpayer's evidence must make it pretty obviousthat the Assessor made a mistake.&nbsp; The key word in the last sentence is the word"evidence".&nbsp; You must give good evidence to support your appeal. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="6" __label="true"> Let me give you an example.&nbsp; You and your next door neighbor get aletter from the Assessor informing you that the value of each house has risen to $75,000.&nbsp; Both houses are identical and both of you fill an appeal before the Board ofEqualization.&nbsp; Your neighbor comes before the Board and says, "This assessmentis ridiculous; my house can't possibly be worth more than $55,000.&nbsp; I only paid$35,000 for it seven years ago.&nbsp; I plan to live the rest of my life in this house.&nbsp; I'm not going to sell it to make a fast buck!" </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="7" __label="true"> When it is your turn to go before the Board, you say, "Thisassessment is ridiculous; my house can't be worth more than $55,000."&nbsp; Then youshow the Board that three other houses in the area have been sold in the last year. &nbsp;The house that was identical to yours sold for $54,000, another house that is similar toyours sold for $56,000.&nbsp; The last house, which was better than yours, sold for$66,000.&nbsp; You show the Board that no houses in the area have sold for more than$66,000.&nbsp; Now this is a pretty simple example by 99 times out of 100 the Board ofEqualization will rule in the following manner:&nbsp; you win your appeal, but yourneighbor's appeal is denied.&nbsp; The reasoning behind these two rulings is this: &nbsp;your neighbor did not present any evidence that supported his contention that the Assessormade a mistake, on the other hand you gave some good hard evidence that supported yourappeal. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="8" __label="true"> Let me explain about the sort of evidence that Boards of Equalization likeand don't like to see.&nbsp; If you tell us that your roof leaks and that there is waterdamage in the house, bring us some pictures that show the damage.&nbsp; Bring an estimatefrom a contractor showing how must it will cost to fix the roof.&nbsp; If your foundationis cracked and the floor is buckled, bring some estimates of the cost to repaireverything.&nbsp; Bring us pictures that backup your contentions.&nbsp; If the Assessorsays your house is worth $50,000 and you have tried for the last year to sell the housefor $45,000 and had no offers, bring a letter from your Realtor confirming it.&nbsp; Showus that a house similar to yours, sold for a good deal less than the assessed value ofyour house.&nbsp; The Board of Equalization is delighted to see good hard evidence. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="9" __label="true"> The Board is not impressed with appeals based on emotion.&nbsp; Don't jumpup and down about the percent of tax increase.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what the percentageof increase is as long as the marketplace will support the value.&nbsp; Don't tell us thatyour grandfather bought the property for $100 fifty years ago and that you have nointentions of ever selling out just to make a buck.&nbsp; The Board could care less aboutyour intentions; the only thing we care about is the present market value. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="10" __label="true"> The best place to get sales information is the Assessor's office. &nbsp;All recorded sales in the county are available there.&nbsp; It will take time and energybut the information is available to you.&nbsp; The easiest way to get another appraisal isto hire a fee appraiser.&nbsp; The fee appraiser can do all the work for you. &nbsp; Thedownside to hiring a fee appraiser is the cost.&nbsp; In addition, the fee appraiser'sreport may or may not support your appeal. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="11" __label="true"> There are three methods for determining the market value of a piece ofproperty:&nbsp; the Direct Sales Comparison method, the Cost Approach to Value, and theIncome Approach to Value.&nbsp; While each method has its strengths and weaknesses, thedirect sales comparison method generally carries the most weight.&nbsp; Almost anyone canuse the direct sales comparison method; all the information you need can be found in theAssessor's office.&nbsp; If you are going to use the cost approach or the income approachit might be wise to take to your accountant and an attorney. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="12" __label="true"> Bring us an argument based only on emotion and outrage and you won't havea chance; bring us some good hard persuasive evidence and the Board may be able to grantyour appeal. </span> </p>
