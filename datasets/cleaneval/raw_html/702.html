          </center> <p> <i> <span __num="125" __label="true"> How would you put a new leather seat in the main valve of the hydrant? </span> </i> </p> <p> <span __num="126" __label="true"> I would shut off hydrant at hydrant branch gate, unscrew bolts that hold bonnet and top plate down. Remove all fittings therefrom. Use wrench that is specially designed for this purpose. Said wrench has a long cylinder and bottom is constructed as to fit the logs of the false bronze seat ring. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> I would give wrench a few turns to the left and unscrew. After this was done, I would pull wrench out of standpipe. Then I would pull spindle out of standpipe with valves attached. Take off 2 iron nuts, take off hold down nut bronze, remove old leather seat, put new leather seat on screw on fittings named above and assemble in same manner. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> Notify Battalion Chief and 1st alarm company. </span> </p> 
          <hr> <i> <b> <span __num="129" __label="true"> What care and attention do valves, hydrants and man holes require? </span> </b> </i> <p> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Valves and hydrants should be inspected each week; should be wiped, oiled, tested and if any leak should be seen around glands, should be taken up or repacked. Hose connections on hydrants should also be inspected and hydrantman should be positive that all threads on same were not jammed so fireman would have no trouble connecting hose. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="131" __label="true"> Man holes should be inspected and keep dry, free from water. Spindles on all outlets should be made to work freely. By opening independent slide valve and keeping main valve closed, it would be possible to know whether main valve seat was tight and in good order. To inspect the independent valve, keep same closed and open main valve. </span> </p>

          </center> <p> <span __num="133" __label="true"> Body: 2 bronze seat rings screwed into casting. Single disc bonnet spindle, stuffing box, gland gears, gear bracket, operating nut, indicator stem, elbows and bypass.. Also bushing. </span> </p> 
          <hr> <i> <b> <span __num="134" __label="true"> If a hydrant was not operating properly where would you look for the trouble? </span> </b> </i> <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> I would immediately look for fault in valve seat. It could be possible for a small rock or piece of wood to get in between valve and seat. And the same might jam valve so it would not seat properly and case a leak. It would also be noticeable on top of spindle. If I thought the valve was damaged to any extent, I would install a new one. </span> </p> 
          <hr> <i> <b> <span __num="136" __label="true"> If you find a high pressure hydrant broken at its outlet what would you do? </span> </b> </i> <p> <span __num="137" __label="true"> I would shut off the gate on the hydrant branch, notify the Battalion Chief and 1st alarm company, and also Supt. of system to send me a new hydrant and 2 laborers. Excavate down to the foot of the hydrant which is about 5 feet, unscrew studs between the foot of the hydrant and the stand pipe. Lift same out with the aid of a tripoid and install new one I had received. Test same, notify Batt. Chief of district and 1st alarm company and report same to Supt. of system. </span> </p> 
          <hr> <i> <b> <span __num="138" __label="true"> How would you drain a portion of the system. Say one block for repairs? </span> </b> </i> <p> <span __num="139" __label="true"> I would close down 2 gates at the intersecting streets so as to cut off supply in that particular block. Open hydrants when water stopped flowing out of hydrants. By this means the section would be dry drained. </span> </p> 
          <hr> <i> <b> <span __num="140" __label="true"> How would you proceed to fill pipes again? </span> </b> </i> <p> <span __num="141" __label="true"> I would plug portion of pipe I had tapped. Leave hydrant open to let air escape. Open section gate very low. After I had line full, I would open other section gate. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="142" __label="true"> I would know that section was full of solid water when hydrant at highest elevation flowed freely. </span> </p> 
          <hr> <i> <b> <span __num="143" __label="true"> How would you test a new section of mains and hydrants in trenches to determine whether section was tight or not and would stand maximum working pressure? </span> </b> </i> <p> <span __num="144" __label="true"> I would attach a line from a low pressure hydrant and connect to suction of hand pump. Connect a line from discharge hand pump to outlet of high pressure hydrant. See that all other hydrants were open to let air escape. Operate low pressure hydrant slow after water was coming out of high pressure hydrant. I would close same and work hand pump to pressure required which would be about 450 pounds per sq. inch. Examine all joints of pipe and hydrant branches and foot of hydrant. If found the same in good order, I would disconnect hand pump, close high and low pressure hydrants, open section gate and let static head come through. The test hydrant valves and report same in good order, ready for service. </span> </p>

[Take] another piece of hose from discharge end of pump to inlet of standpipe Siamese. Turn on water at hydrant when it reached the roof and flowed freely through valve on roof. Close roof valve which will give hydrant pressure. Return to pump and work pump until gauge showed required pressure which would be about 300 pounds per square inch. Then examine standpipe. Finding same in good condition, I turned off water at hydrant, release pressure by opening jet cock on pump. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="150" __label="true"> Return to ground floor, open drain valve located at bottom of standpipe. When properly drained, disconnect hose at hydrant to pump, from pump to inlet of standpipe Siamese, replaced all caps and plug. Close roof valve and report same. </span> </p>

Keep them full of water. See that they are ready for immediate use at all times. If anything should happen to impair their stability, these should be reported to the Battalion Chief of district and Supt. of High Pressure System. There are 58 cisterns which vary from 18,000 gallons and up.

Open cap on 3 1/2 inch outlet. Open the main valve in the same hole bored for that purpose. Close main cover, open 3 inch outlet independent valve which releases pressure. Then proceed to take off all caps and open all independent valves. Wipe all fittings with a piece of waste saturated with kerosene so as to free the same from all dust. Oil all independent valves and bushing. Oil all outlets. Close independent valves, see that same are not manned. Screw on caps on outlets. Be sure that main valve is seated. If main valve should leak through gland, same should be taken up or repacked. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="158" __label="true"> After hydrant is put in good working condition, the number of same and also hydrant gate should be noted.
