            <p> <span __num="120" __label="true"> Then James Toback is your rainmaker, and WHEN WILL I BE LOVED your perverse, perfect storm.&nbsp; For everyone else, it's just further evidence of a one-time worthwhile filmmaker's creative decline that began with BLACK AND WHITE in 1999. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="121" __label="true"> Toback's an odd bird:&nbsp; a spoiled rich kid who insinuated himself into the black counterculture back in the late 1960's while gambling himself into serious debt *and* running up a tab of sexual conquests that would make Wilt Chamberlin break out his calculator.&nbsp; He also allegedly took the biggest hit of LSD in recorded history (the annals of drug history being so scrupulously reliable).&nbsp; In other words, the motherfucker lived his ass off, and, for over twenty years, these lurid exploits were often the fuel for great screenplays (e.g. THE GAMBLER, </span> <a href="http://archive.salon.com/sex/turn_on/2002/10/24/fingers/"> <span __num="122" __label="true"> FINGERS </span> </a> <span __num="123" __label="true"> and BUGSY) that captured life dangling over the precipice.&nbsp; I adore FINGERS; it's </span> <em> <span __num="124" __label="true"> im </span> </em> <span __num="125" __label="true"> pure male id spurted out at 24fps about a schizophrenic concert pianist/thug (Harvey Keitel) who bears a bruising resemblance to the filmmaker himself.&nbsp; It's got a Cassavetes-esque wildness about it, though it's absent the indie pioneer's humanism.&nbsp; There isn't a kind bone in FINGERS' body; it's a masterpiece of misanthropy that enrages as much as it dazzles.&nbsp; If you've never seen it, do so.&nbsp; (Working up a head of steam writing about it, I'm wishing I had a copy at the ready myself.) </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="126" __label="true"> Even when Toback is overbearing, which is always, he gets such nakedly honest performances out of his lead actors that the films, ostensibly personal statements for the writer/director, become dual confessionals.&nbsp; Most people either love or hate TWO GIRLS AND A GUY; despite Natasha Gregson Wagner's most useless performance in a career littered with them, I think it's a phenomenal high wire act by Robert Downey, Jr., who rescues Toback's worst writing impulses with one of the great virtuoso film performances of the last twenty years.&nbsp; Watching him as he flits about his Manhattan loft bellowing the first movement of Vivaldi's GLORIA or banging out a flamboyant rendition of "You Don't Know Me' at the piano while ineptly playing traffic cop in the two-car pileup that is his love life is to see a limitlessly talented actor redline it for ninety minutes.&nbsp; It's the performance people had been waiting to see Downey, Jr. give for years, and selfishly hoping he'd get around to before killing himself.&nbsp; (Thankfully, he's still with us, though it's been since WONDER BOYS that he brought his "A" game.) </span> <br> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> If Toback's ear was getting a bit tinny with that film, he went stone cold tone deaf with BLACK AND WHITE, which felt like Toback trying to reassert his hipster cred within the African-American community by casting every hip-hop or sports star available.&nbsp; Most of the Wu-Tang Clan shows up, as does Mike Tyson, but Toback the filmmaker does not, and the film collapses into a heap of disconnected scenes that are only occasionally amusing (e.g. Robert Downey, Jr. risking his life in the name of improv by propositioning Tyson).&nbsp; It's the kind of disaster that would've made for a great behind-the-scenes documentary.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one has not emerged. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> Toback followed BLACK AND WHITE up with HARVARD MAN, which was so slipshod in its execution I didn't think him capable of a more dubious achievement.&nbsp; And that brings us back to WHEN WILL I BE LOVED.&nbsp; Once again, Toback trots out his famous friends -- Damon Dash, Mike Tyson and Lori Singer -- to show us that he's -- yes, Lori Singer -- still a man about town.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he's investigating the balance of power in male/female relationships, and how it's predicated by material wealth.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I lost interest early on when Frederick Weller got into an exposition-crammed screaming match with some bimbo on Times Square.&nbsp; Though there was always an element of the undisciplined about Toback, he was never this clumsy in setting up his narrative. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="129" __label="true"> But I kept it on mostly for the prurient pleasure of watching Neve Campbell in the buff, </span> <em> <span __num="130" __label="true"> not </span> </em> <span __num="131" __label="true"> to see her get shtupped by Dominic Chianese (the only kind of fucking I want to see Uncle Junior doing is the figurative sort).&nbsp; As for Toback, you may still be living the wild life at sixty, but your dispatches from the edge have gone from exhilarating to pathetic.&nbsp; It's an act that's no longer becoming.&nbsp; Time to keep it to yourself, man. </span> </p>

            <p> <span __num="201" __label="true"> Well, if you're as unabashed a fan of Harlin's idiotic, logic-flouting sequel as I am, you can read the homage as Richet signaling his crass, audience pleasing intent.&nbsp; In fact, you'd really better read it as such; otherwise, you're in for a long, tedious journey through an exhaustive compendium of 1980's action film cliches that might be serving some greater thematic purpose if you </span> <a href="http://www.chireader.com/movies/archives/2005/0105/050121_2.html"> <span __num="202" __label="true"> make the mistake of looking too closely </span> </a> <span __num="203" __label="true"> .&nbsp; Granted, the gritty seriousness of the opening prologue, in which Roenick inadvertently sacrifices his undercover colleagues during a drug buy gone bad, and its Detroit setting get things off to a rollicking, NARC-ish start, but the minute the grinding mechanics of the plot kick in, and we realize that the information imparted in that prologue could've been handled with one simple perception shift in the police station set-up, we know immediately that we're watching trash.&nbsp; The question is whether it's moronic or self-aware trash. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="204" __label="true"> This is where someone might be tempted to take me to task for suggesting that Renny Harlin has a self-aware bone in his burly Finnish body, to which I say "Samuel L. Jackson in DEEP BLUE SEA."&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously, there's something subversive going on in the guy's shamelessly lousy pictures, and that "something" is what Richet has deigned to ape to modestly diverting returns.&nbsp; Call it the ROAD HOUSE principle:&nbsp; if the filmmaker doesn't insult our intelligence by putting on airs, we'll gladly roll in the muck with him. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="205" __label="true"> And, aside from that unnecessary prologue, that's mostly what Richet does, obviating the narrative inefficiency of James DeMonaco's bloated script by amping up the violence and getting decent performances out of his very good ensemble (save for an annoying-from-his-first-overly-mannered-twitch John Leguizamo).&nbsp; Which is not to say that this go-for-broke sensibility results in any memorable set pieces; again, like Harlin, Richet may be able to pull of a single, well-composed shot (e.g. Gabriel Byrne's confrontation with Maria Bello), but his action choreography is pretty lackluster.&nbsp; Still, despite the disposability of the major sequences, they get the job done in decent workmanlike fashion. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="206" __label="true"> I certainly understand </span> <a href="http://aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=19171"> <span __num="207" __label="true"> Harry's enthusiasm </span> </a> <span __num="208" __label="true"> for the film, and concede that he might be on to something with viewing ASSAULT as a hardcore throwback to 80's genre garbage (though I see a lot more Glickenhaus than Pyun on display here).&nbsp; But this film is competent in a way those films so hilariously were not.&nbsp; Richet's work is strictly Harlin-ville -- not a bad place to hang out so long as you're familiar with and accepting of the terrain. </span> </p>

            <p> <span __num="457" __label="true"> TWENTYNINE PALMS' David, on the other hand, is an ignoramus of Gump-ian proportions.&nbsp; In one of the film's most infuriating sequences (though not *the* most infuriating), David allows his emotionally fragile French girlfriend, with whom he can barely communicate, to drive his Hummer through heavy desert brush.&nbsp; Thematic implications aside, the gesture is monumentally stupid in that a) she can't drive, and b) he's obviously uptight about his cherry red Hummer, and, hell, even he'd have trouble navigating the brush that lies ahead.&nbsp; I know, I know... this shows him attempting to shed his controlling personality (or piquing it out of a bizarre masochistic impulse), but whereas he'd been marginally interesting up until this point, this sequence exposes him as an asshole </span> <em> <span __num="458" __label="true"> and </span> </em> <span __num="459" __label="true"> imbecile of the first order.&nbsp; On the other hand, his girlfriend, Katia, remains relatively tolerably unstable until she carelessly lures a three-legged dog into the path of their Hummer.&nbsp; Alas, MENSA won't be breaking down her door anytime soon, either. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="460" __label="true"> Dumont's blasting away at a number of targets here -- the exacerbated, post-Iraq American-French disconnect; male sexual primacy; American environmental rape -- but his rounds are backfiring on him.&nbsp; As with L'HUMANITE, he's in complete control of his craft; unfortunately, the company he chooses to keep renders his masterful slow build excruciating this time out. </span> </p>

            <p> <span __num="567" __label="true"> As for other Cleveland sports news... is anyone really surprised that Romeo Crennel "blew away" the Browns front office?&nbsp; What'll really surprise me is if he's fool enough to take the job (though I'd love to see it happen).&nbsp; And the Indians finally make an off-season free agent signing that might help them win the AL Central, but getting Millwood at this stage in his career reminds me of our blown Jack McDowell deal back in the mid-90's.&nbsp; I see this guy being on the IR for most of '05, or going 11-10 while the Indians struggle to score runs. </span> </p>
