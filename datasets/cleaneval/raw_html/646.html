It is my responsibility to support my community, friends and family by giving back all that I can. I believe that all things happen for a reason and God has allowed me to be involved with the Relay for Life in order to show me cancer, its affects and allow these to touch my life. So when I think about why I Relay it’s to serve my friends and community, to continue the fight against this tragic disease and to touch others lives as I my self have been touched. I can only hope that my efforts compel another person to join this fight. </span> </font> </p>

This year, I wanted to make a bigger difference, so I decided to form a team of my own. Then in November, I was given an even bigger reason. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. But, I knew we had work to do and I had to be brave and have a deeper faith than ever before. I thank the Lord everyday because the cancer was removed and now she is going through radiation treatments. My mom is a survivor! </span> </p> <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> I am co-captain of Bells Angels, from Bells Baptist church. Our church has been hit hard by cancer over the past few years.

I had not been involved in the first Relay For Life event, but had heard wonderful things about it. I took the challenge, and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful things I have done in my life. When cancer strikes someone you love there is not much you can do but pray, and be supportive. I lost my grandfather to colon cancer, my grandmother was a breast cancer survivor, my father is a melanoma survivor, two cousins died of melanoma at ages 41 and 51, and I have another cousin in her fight with breast cancer, and it does not stop there. My best friend from college days has a 7 year old daughter who was diagnosed at age 4 with liver cancer. She is in her third year after her transplant and doing great! </span> </p> <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> At our church alone we have lost several wonderful church members to cancer. We do have cancer survivors in our church and I Relay for them with the hope that they will be with us for a long, long time. It makes me feel good to know that the money we raise at Relay filters into the lives of survivors at some point in time. My hope is that through this fundraising future generations will have alternatives for treatment and a higher success rate for a cure.

I hope you don't mind me taking up some of your space. I Relay for my grandmother&nbsp;that I never knew because she died from cancer before I was even born, I've been told that I get my red hair and my love of reading from her, but I'll never know. I Relay for Nick, one of the first friends I can remember, he had leukemia. I remember him not having any hair and always wearing a fireman's hat, he never got to grow up, he died at the age of 11.&nbsp;I Relay for my&nbsp;aunt who is a breast cancer survivor, she is my proof that this disease can be beaten. I Relay for my uncle, who I named my team after, The Corriveau Crusaders, he survived stomach cancer, only to succumb to pancreatic cancer a year later. There have been others in my life who fought their battles with cancer, a friend's uncle, a teacher, a neighbor, some have won, others have lost. The wound that is still the freshest and the most painful is the one caused by the loss of "Pa". Pa was my surrogate grandfather, since I never had one of my own, he was my friend's grandfather and I lived next to him my entire life. He was an amazing man to everyone who knew him. He had lung cancer and had had portions of lung removed years earlier, it finally caught up to him and he died last March 2004. I Relay so I can do my part to eradicate this awful disease. </span> </font> </p> <p align="right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial"> <font size="4"> <span __num="67" __label="true"> Kim Filion </span> </font> </font> </p> <p align="right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font color="#000080" size="4"> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="68" __label="true"> The Corriveau Crusaders </span> </font> </font> </p> <p align="right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial" size="4"> <span __num="69" __label="true"> C </span> </font> <font color="#000080" face="Arial" size="4"> <span __num="70" __label="true"> heshire, CT </span> </font> </p>
