The information provided here covers all taxa that have been assigned an IUCN Red List Category with the exception of those designated as Not Evaluated (NE). All the assessments presented, except those for geographically isolated subpopulations or stocks, are for the taxon (species, subspecies or variety) as a whole (i.e. they indicate the global risk of extinction).

Non-mandatory information is also collected on life history attributes, the value of species for human livelihoods and the importance of species to ecosystem processes.

The naming of such islands follows edition 2 of the </span> <a href="http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/gis/tdwg/" target="_new"> <span __num="109" __label="true"> World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions </span> </a> <span __num="110" __label="true"> (Brummitt </span> <i> <span __num="111" __label="true"> et al </span> </i> <span __num="112" __label="true"> . 2001) prepared for the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases (TDWG). The TDWG geographic system also provides a standard set of Basic Recording Units (BRU) that are sub-country units based on provinces or states. The BRU's are used to subdivide very large countries like Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, etc. into smaller more conveniently sized units for recording distributions. This system has been adopted for the IUCN Red List wherever possible. Most plant taxa on the Red List have had their distributions recorded down to BRU level where appropriate, but unfortunately sub-country information is still lacking for most of the animal species. Hence this feature is not currently searchable. Each country or territory has also been assigned to a single geographic region to enable users to search by larger geographic areas. (View the list of </span> <a href="regions"> <span __num="113" __label="true"> Countries by Regions </span> </a> <span __num="114" __label="true"> ). </span> </font> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <span __num="115" __label="true"> Geopolitical events during recent years may have led to some inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided. Within reasonable limits every effort has been made to determine which of the new nations that were part of the former Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and USSR support species previously attributed to the larger unit. There may be some species in the Red List that have still not been fully resolved. Adherence to the ISO system also creates some problems, as there is often a time lag between a political change and a new ISO code being allocated for the new country. The version of the ISO codes used for example, maintains Hong Kong and Macao as separate units. </span> </font> </p> <p> <a name="dist_vagrants"> </a> </p> <h2> <a name="dist_vagrants"> <span __num="116" __label="true"> Doubtful Distributions and Vagrants </span> </a> </h2> <a name="dist_vagrants"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <span __num="117" __label="true"> The distributions of some species in certain countries have not been confirmed. These are indicated as possibly doubtful occurrences by the inclusion of a '?' after the country name. These instances are distinct from vagrant distributions that are usually displayed separately with a [vag] or [vag?] flag after the country name.But combinations of doubtful country occurrences and vagrants plus doubtful countries and dubious vagrants are also possible. So care should be taken when using the distribution information for subsequent analyses.Likewise, for a number of very widespread Least Concern taxa, the list of country occurrences may be incomplete or in some instances not even recorded (e.g., </span> <em> <span __num="118" __label="true"> Mus musculus </span> </em> <span __num="119" __label="true"> ) because such taxa are virtually cosmopolitan.

For many inland water species, usually those restricted to a single water system, inland water ranges are also given with a clear indication from the name if it is a river or a lake. In a few instances, a second river name (e.g. Colorado River, Concho River) indicates a section of the drainage in which the species occurs. In most cases, the countries in which these freshwater species occur are also recorded, but there are a few instances (e.g., cichlid fish in Lake Victoria), where the precise country distribution is unknown, so the only distribution information is the Lake name. </span> </font> <p> <a name="dist_intro"> </a> </p> <h2> <a name="dist_intro"> <span __num="132" __label="true"> Introductions, Reintroductions and Extinctions </span> </a> </h2> <p> <a name="dist_intro"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <span __num="133" __label="true"> In most cases where a species is known to have been introduced or reintroduced to a country, this is indicated by an [int] or [re-int] after the country name in the distribution text.
