   <p align="left"> <span __num="7" __label="true"> This is being written on March 30, 2001.&nbsp; It is beingupdated on April 5, 2001.&nbsp; I apologize for the delay in getting thisposted. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="8" __label="true"> (An additional one-word revision was made on May 14 to correct asilly typo - nothing substantive.) </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="9" __label="true"> The preliminary report may be found at </span> <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-13mar01.htm"> <span __num="10" __label="true"> http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-13mar01.htm </span> </a> <span __num="11" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="12" __label="true"> This was a public board meeting. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="13" __label="true"> When I left Santa Cruz, California to go to the Melbournemeeting, there was no well-formed agenda.&nbsp; For the most part theresolutions below were formulated by ICANN "staff" on the night beforethe March 13 meeting.&nbsp; Indeed the first time I saw the text of theseresolutions was when they appeared on the computer monitors before me during themeeting. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="14" __label="true"> The general sense of these resolutions was discussed in analmost closed meeting of the Board on the evening of March 12.&nbsp; I say"almost closed" because of the presence and active participation of atleast two people (other than ICANN's in-house counsel, who I believe is anappropriate person to invite to a board meeting) who are not members of theICANN board, one of whom is neither an ICANN officer nor even an ICANNemployee.&nbsp; I do not feel that this is appropriate.&nbsp; If these people want to act as ICANN board members, then it ismy feeling that they ought to stand for election.&nbsp; Otherwise I feel that aslong as the public is excluded then these people ought to be excluded unlessexplicitly invited for a limited purpose to provide information on a specificmatter. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="15" __label="true"> It is my feeling that since real discussion of matters occurredat this March 12 meeting, that such meeting ought to have been open to thepublic or at least recorded so that the public could hear what whatdiscussed.&nbsp; I do not subscribe to the point of view that ICANN that boardmembers require a cloak of secrecy except with respect to personnel matters,litigation, or contract negotiations. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="16" __label="true"> I must say that I felt rushed.&nbsp; I felt that"staff" had created a situation inwhich major policy matters were dumped in the Board's lap with inadequate timefor study of for review by the Board or the public.&nbsp; One point that I dowant to make clear: I have no evidence or indication that this situation was theresult of any intent or purpose and I see no reason why anyone should entertainany theory that this situation was the result of any manipulativeintention.&nbsp; That does not mean, however, that we (ICANN) ought to notimprove procedures so that this situation does not frequently recur.&nbsp; (Wemust recognize that some matters will always be changing right up to the lastminute and that sometimes everyone ought to simply accept the situation and givesuch leeway as is reasonable.) </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="17" __label="true"> As an example of what happens when there is a rush - When the resolution on the report of theso-called Ad Hoc Group (on addressing) was presented it was not clearlypointed out that the report was not approved by the full membership of the AdHoc Group.&nbsp; It was only later, in a chance meeting at an airport, that I foundout that at least two members of that group - people whose technical judgment I trust -refused to sign-off on the report. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="18" __label="true"> It is my belief that no resolution should be voted upon by theICANN board until the exact text of that resolution has been posted for at leastseveral days. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="19" __label="true"> There is also a matter of completeness.&nbsp; ICANN's web site is the primary vehicle by whichinformation is made available to the public and to the board.&nbsp; Yet that website is sometimes as impenetrable as the Minotaur's maze.&nbsp; Consequently it isnow my belief that every resolution must contain </span> <i> <span __num="20" __label="true"> usable </span> </i> <span __num="21" __label="true"> references to </span> <i> <span __num="22" __label="true"> all </span> </i> <span __num="23" __label="true"> materials directly pertaining to that resolution. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="24" __label="true"> I felt that the ICANN board was engaging in severalsignificant procedural failures, principally the failure to have adequate timefor public review and failure to properly delegate matters to the DNSO asrequired by the ICANN by-laws. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="25" __label="true"> My primary focus during the meetings in Melbourne was theAt-Large study.&nbsp; I have significant reservations about that study,particularly since it's committee was selected without any input from theat-large community and with the expressed intention to exclude anyone who hasindicated that they consider the at-large to be an important and necessary partof ICANN.&nbsp; I endeavored to find a way to enhance the committee membershipbut found no way to do so that would have had even a prayer of being adopted bythe ICANN board. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="26" __label="true"> Although it was not a matter for vote, the proposed amendmentsto the VeriSign agreement did occupy a lot of discussion time.&nbsp; PersonallyI was taken aback by the fait accompli "take it or leave it" packagethat ICANN's "staff" presented to the Board.&nbsp; Given the gravityof those amendments I considered the process to be an inversion of the properrelationship between the should-be-master policy-making role of the Board andthe should-be subservient policy-executing role of "staff". </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Moreover, the VeriSign amendments </span> <i> <span __num="28" __label="true"> do </span> </i> <span __num="29" __label="true"> represent significantchanges of Domain Name policy.&nbsp; And the ICANN bylaws dictate that suchmatters be delegated to the DNSO unless the board makes a finding that there arefacts to bypass that clearly defined requirement to delegate to the DNSO.&nbsp;The board has not made any such finding with respect to the VeriSign amendments.&nbsp;I recognize the argument that says that the VeriSign amendments were not"policy" changes, but I am not persuaded by them. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="30" __label="true"> With regard to the DNSO, it is my perception that it is a bodythat is wracked with internal problems and structural biases.&nbsp; As such Ihave a difficult time giving credence to its actions.&nbsp; This makes it verydifficult with regard to the fact that much as it is procedurally critical todelegate matters such as the VeriSign amendments to the DNSO, it is equallydifficult to believe that the DNSO would be able to synthesize a decision thatcould be considered as having been fairly decided by all parts of the Internetcommunity. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="31" __label="true"> As an example of this lack of credibility of the DNSO, I amparticularly concerned how the DNSO's Names Council eviscerated the proposalsfor structural reform of the DNSO that came out of the DNSO working groupfocused on those questions. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Now for the resolutions themselves: </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Approval of Minutes </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="34" __label="true"> I voted for this one.&nbsp; (There's usually not muchcontroversy about approving minutes. ;-) </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="35" __label="true"> Recommendations of Reconsideration Committee </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="36" __label="true"> I&nbsp; voted to accept the two reports. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="37" __label="true"> The two "Requests For Reconsideration" that were upfor approval did not strike me as particularly compelling in and ofthemselves.&nbsp; In this case I felt that the Reconsideration Committee came upwith the correct result. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="38" __label="true"> However, I do find that these two requests are indicative of alarger pattern of discontent with the overall TLD selection process. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Ad Hoc Group </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="40" __label="true"> I voted against accepting the Ad Hoc group's report.&nbsp; Iconsider the entire Ad Hoc Group to be beyond ICANN's proper scope of authorityand hence it would be improper to accept its report no matter what its quality. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="41" __label="true"> I note, however, that I have subsequently learned that thereport that was tendered was not the report of the entire Ad Hoc Group - thereport was unable to obtain the approval of at various group members in whom Iplace a great deal of technical credence.&nbsp; It is not clear to me that otherboard members were aware of the report's shaky foundation at the time the votewas made on the resolution. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Membership of At Large Membership Study Committee </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="43" __label="true"> I voted for this one, even though, as I mentioned above, I havemajor reservations about this At-Large Study Committee, particularly itscharter, its membership, and its ability to arrive at a result that will begranted legitimacy by the public. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> I still hold hope that this committee can be expanded to includeadditional members who have strong at-large credentials. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Budget for At Large Membership Study Committee </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="46" __label="true"> I voted yes.&nbsp; I see no reason why my reservations about theAt-Large Study Committee's composition or charter should prevent it from atleast trying to show me wrong. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Proposed Revision to VeriSign Agreements </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Please note that this resolution was not to approve the proposedchanges to the VeriSign contract but merely continues the admittedly limitedprocess for public comment. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="49" __label="true"> As I said during the meeting, my feeling is that properprocedure requires that this matter be passed to the DNSO, although I do havereservations about the ability of the DNSO to render a decision given itsinternal procedural infirmities. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="50" __label="true"> New TLD Agreements </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="51" __label="true"> I voted for this.&nbsp; That was a mistake.&nbsp; I wish I hadvoted against. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="52" __label="true"> My affirmative vote was the result of inadequate time to studyand to receive public input.&nbsp; I have since learned various things aboutthese contracts that, had I known at the time, would have made me vote againstapproval. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="53" __label="true"> I knee-jerk accepted these contracts based on a desire to movethe long-delayed TLD process.&nbsp; I am now resolved to not let myself berailroaded by last-minute "staff" agendas to accept something that Ido not believe has received adequate review by myself or the public. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="54" __label="true"> Among the matters that I learned about too late were the concernthat these contracts may establish what amounts to a "most favoredregistry" situation in which incumbent registries may be able to use thesecontracts as a means to prevent experimentation and evolution of new contractualvehicles with respect to subsequent registries. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Another such matter was the nature of the buy-out situation thatmay occur when a registry contract comes up for renewal. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Similarly, I was unaware of the lack of an effective "fullstop" mechanism or other protective means that would, to my way ofthinking, be necessary parts of any live experiment or test, such as these newTLDs are purported to be. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="57" __label="true"> DNSO Review </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="58" __label="true"> There was a bit of procedural chaos at this point in themeeting.&nbsp; We managed to get off onto a short discussion of a DNSOconstituency for individual people who own domain names.&nbsp; I consider thatto be something that we very much do want in the DNSO.&nbsp; However, the matteron the table at that time was the DNSO review and, as I said, there was a bit ofconfusion caused by the mix of the two issues. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="59" __label="true"> I wanted to discuss the fact that I believe that the DNSO reviewprocess was, simply put, unacceptable.&nbsp; I do not accept that the reportthat emanated from the Names Council is an accurate reflection of theinfirmities of the DNSO. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="60" __label="true"> Appointment of Auditors </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="61" __label="true"> I voted yes. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Disbursement and Check Signing Authority </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="63" __label="true"> I voted yes. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Handling of DNSO Funds </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="65" __label="true"> This is something that I was very pleased to vote for.&nbsp; Ihave been very concerned about the lack of clarity surrounding the funds thatICANN holds on behalf of the DNSO.&nbsp; There is no reason to suspect thatthere is any problem; rather I feel that when money is involved, absolute clarity ofaccounting is important, particularly when there are discussions aboutalienating that money at some future date to another entity. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="66" __label="true"> Agreements with ccTLD Managers </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="67" __label="true"> I abstained from this vote.&nbsp; I simply do not have enoughknowledge of this matter for me to feel comfortable that I could have made aninformed decision. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="68" __label="true"> Internationalized Domain Names </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="69" __label="true"> I voted yes. </span> </p> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="70" __label="true"> Internationalized domain names are a big and complexissue.&nbsp; And I believe that the committee that is formed by this resolutionwill help all of us better understand the issues. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="71" __label="true"> Thanks to Local Hosts and Sponsors </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="72" __label="true"> Of course I voted yes.&nbsp; The Melbourne hosts and sponsorsdid a very nice job and deserve much thanks. </span> </p> 
   <h4 align="left"> <span __num="73" __label="true"> Thanks to Lennie and Mike Roberts </span> </h4> 
   <p align="left"> <span __num="74" __label="true"> Henry IV, King of France from 1589 through 1610 was reputed tohave said to have avoided a battle by making a pragmatic recognition that"Paris is worth a mass".&nbsp; I believe that the departure of MikeRoberts from ICANN will bring a significant change in the personality of theorganization.&nbsp; I thank him for leaving. </span> </p>
