         <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="29" __label="true"> It was only a few months ago that Beacon Hill lawmakers, worried about financial crises overseas and a spate of local layoffs, were talking about belt-tightening, hoarding cash, and boosting the state's rainy day fund in anticipation of a recession that some seemed certain was just over the horizon. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="30" __label="true"> But money kept pouring in. The political rhetoric about how many months the $1.2 billion emergency reserves could sustain the state began to fade. Agendas blossomed. Spending became the order of the day. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="31" __label="true"> Governor Paul Cellucci produced the largest budget ever filed in Massachusetts history containing plans to lower the income tax rate and heap millions of dollars on pet projects and programs. Weeks later he said he wanted to spend another $300 million from a projected state surplus on one-time road and bridge improvements. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Even before Cellucci got the spending bug, Speaker Thomas M. Finneran unveiled an ambitious and expensive plan to offer public preschool and full-day kindergarten. And Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham cited the surging economy as a reason to sharply increase the minimum wage. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Despite the spending euphoria, economists are still nervous about the not-too-distant future. They say fewer jobs will be created. The financial service sector could be hit by a stock market crash. And consumer confidence may wane. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="34" __label="true"> "One way or another, the economy is going to slow in '99," says Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. "It doesn't have to go down the tubes like it did a decade ago.... A recession is unlikely and Massachusetts wouldn't do any worse than the rest of the country in terms of job loss and how long it stayed down, but the fact that we haven't had a slowdown yet means people should be more cautious, not less cautious." </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="35" __label="true"> While Cellucci's budget message for next year is filled with warnings about "profligate spending" and reminders "of what can happen when government gets caught up in the euphoria that prevails during a robust economy," his record $20.4 billion spending plan represents a 5 percent boost over fiscal 1999, giving across-the-board increases to dozens of agencies and programs. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="36" __label="true"> The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a fiscal watchdog group, issued two reports last month, </span> <em> <span __num="37" __label="true"> "Reaching the Breaking Point: The Commonwealth's Capital Dilemma" </span> </em> <span __num="38" __label="true"> and </span> <em> <span __num="39" __label="true"> "Budget '99: Containing the Euphoria," </span> </em> <span __num="40" __label="true"> both flagging the potential for a crisis. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="41" __label="true"> "We're still phasing in last year's tax cuts. The economy has already outperformed everyone's expectation for much longer than anyone anticipated. This clearly can't go on forever and there are some problems," said Michael Widmer, executive director of the taxpayers foundation. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="42" __label="true"> He points to the so-called budget busters -- funding for the MBTA, health care for state employees, and Medicaid -- climbing to unforeseen levels. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="43" __label="true"> "The budget is exploding," Widmer added. "At the same time, we have this huge problem of trying to identify enough capital resources to invest in a long list of important priorities while paying for the Central Artery." </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Last week, Cellucci said he would pour much of the state's cash surplus into one-time highway and bridge projects, taking some of the pressure off the capital budget. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="45" __label="true"> But such a spending luxury could be short-lived. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="46" __label="true"> The state's infrastructure -- roads, buildings, bridges, pipes, etc. -- is among the oldest in the nation and could easily siphon millions out of the general fund for needed repairs over the </span> <a name="next"> <span __num="47" __label="true"> next </span> </a> <span __num="48" __label="true"> few years. If Cellucci's pitch to reduce the income tax rate in stages from 5.95 percent to 5 percent is successful, it could take $1.2 billion out of the coffers in just the first year </span> <font color="#FF0000"> <em> <span __num="49" __label="true"> [sic] </span> </em> </font> <span __num="50" __label="true"> , possibly eliminating any surplus, thereby stretching the capital budget thinner. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank who believes the state's soaring times are in for a "soft landing," said it is evident that politicians are struggling to determine how to spend this year's cash without permanently elevating expectations. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="52" __label="true"> "Growth is likely to diminish," Breimyer said. "The political establishment here is trying to find a middle line. I think they've done a reasonably good job. There has been a sense of prudence. And I think prudence is warranted." </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="53" __label="true"> However, cities and towns, which have received local aid increases each of the last eight years -- a 113 percent overall jump in spending since 1992 -- are already clamoring for more than the $4.5 billion Cellucci is offering for next year. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="54" __label="true"> Holyoke Mayor Daniel Szostkiewicz says major local aid increases over the last four years have fueled a renaissance in his city, luring young families back who once would have shunned the shabby schools, which now have new books and are wired for the Internet. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="55" __label="true"> "It was great. It was absolutely phenomenal," Szostkiewicz. "But when you go from multimillion dollar increases to level funding, it feels like you're just hitting a wall." </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Of course, he is already talking about "working the Legislature" on getting more than the $60 million Holyoke is already promised. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="57" __label="true"> All this frustrates the governor's office. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="58" __label="true"> "You can't open the piggy bank for everyone all the time," said Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer. "You have to impose controls. The most critical way to do that is to take money off the table by reducing the income tax." </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="59" __label="true"> Will the Legislature approve the rate cut? </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="60" __label="true"> Senate President Birmingham hopes not. </span> </big> </p> 
           <p align="left"> <big> <span __num="61" __label="true"> "I'm not Nostradamus," he said. "And I don't know if the governor has Nostradamus advising him. I don't know when the economy will slow down ... and for that reason I take a cautious approach." </span> </big> </p>
