      <p> <span __num="8" __label="true"> Someone got to B.D. via this </span> <a <="" a="" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=bin+laden+has+not+been+heard+from+since"> <span __num="9" __label="true"> Google search today </span> </a> <span __num="10" __label="true"> (too lazy to click through? The search: "bin laden has not been heard from since"). </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Well, since when? Since </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1211740,00.html"> <span __num="12" __label="true"> May 7th of this year </span> </a> <span __num="13" __label="true"> when an (unauthenticated) audiotape emerged purporting to be UBL offering gold in return for Jerry Bremer's assasination. Pretty piddling fare for Osama, no? Reduced to offering grams of gold for the head of a mere American proconsul? Note that was about half a year ago. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="14" __label="true"> Before that, there was that "truce" offer--ostensibly for the benefit of those baddies in 'New' Europe--back on April 15th (also, as far as I can tell, unauthenticated). And on </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1116250,00.html"> <span __num="15" __label="true"> January 4 </span> </a> <span __num="16" __label="true"> of this year, another audiotape purporting to be Bin Laden aired on al-Jazeera. Interestingly, that was the first audio in which, according to the Guardian ( </span> <i> <span __num="17" __label="true"> ed. note: Did I just write that phrase straight-faced </span> </i> <span __num="18" __label="true"> ?], "the voice introduces itself as Osama bin Laden at the beginning of the tape." This raises my suspicion a little. After all, why must the great Sheikh explain it is He who is doing the speaking? Still, ostensibly, at least some analysts judged the audio to likely </span> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3368709.stm"> <span __num="19" __label="true"> be authentic </span> </a> <span __num="20" __label="true"> . But other reports I've seen are </span> <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/05/terror/main591285.shtml"> <span __num="21" __label="true"> more cautious about confirming its authenticity </span> </a> <span __num="22" __label="true"> [ </span> <i> <span __num="23" __label="true"> ed. note: The Beeb vs. CBS!?! I link, you decide </span> </i> <span __num="24" __label="true"> !] </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> The last </span> <i> <span __num="26" __label="true"> video </span> </i> <span __num="27" __label="true"> (rather than audio) tape? You have to go back to </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1066447,00.html"> <span __num="28" __label="true"> October 19th, 2003 </span> </a> <span __num="29" __label="true"> --about a year ago. But there is no voiceover, no attempt to evidence the date of the footage, and UBL appears "healthy" (in sharp contrast to a gaunt-looking UBL in </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,624975,00.html"> <span __num="30" __label="true"> December of '01 </span> </a> <span __num="31" __label="true"> ) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Before then? A video on </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1039792,00.html"> <span __num="33" __label="true"> September 11, 2003 </span> </a> <span __num="34" __label="true"> . But there is no real time voice on this video either: </span> </p> 
      <blockquote> 
       <span __num="35" __label="true"> The tape shows a figure believed to be Bin Laden, the leader of the al-Qaida network, dressed in Afghan-style robes and walking in rocky mountainous terrain, apparently accompanied by his chief lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was aired on the Arab television network al-Jazeera. </span> 
       <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> The men do not address the camera. But on a soundtrack accompanying the tape Zawahiri is heard exhorting fighters in Iraq to rise up against the occupying forces and "devour the Americans". He names the US president, George Bush, and Tony Blair as the "top criminals". </span> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <p> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Funny, just two weeks later, </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1052028,00.html"> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Zawahiri releases a tape </span> </a> <span __num="39" __label="true"> . Solo. Why not do a joint audio since, just a couple weeks back, they were strolling through the mountains together? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Next, check out </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/page/0,12643,839823,00.html"> <span __num="41" __label="true"> this timeline </span> </a> <span __num="42" __label="true"> . Note that al-Qaeda released three tapes between December '02 and April '03. </span> </p> 
      <p> <u> <span __num="43" __label="true"> None </span> </u> <span __num="44" __label="true"> featured UBL! Why? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> After that, there was the November '03 audio tape, again purporting to be UBL's voice, that claimed responsibility for Bali etc. But, Swiss scientists deem it </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,851112,00.html"> <span __num="46" __label="true"> likely a fake </span> </a> <span __num="47" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Next, continuing in reverse chronological order? A tape where al-Qaeda formally take responsibility for 9/11--on </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,798048,00.html"> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Sept 10 2002 </span> </a> <span __num="50" __label="true"> . Again, it's supposed to be UBL--but note, per the Guardian: "There was nothing to indicate that the sound-only recording attributed to Bin Laden had been made since the war in Afghanistan." </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> On June 23rd of '02, al-Q spokesman Abu Ghaith informs us UBL is alive. Why does he need to so proclaim? Why doesn't UBL tell us himself? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Other videos? </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,684901,00.html"> <span __num="53" __label="true"> April 15th, 2002 </span> </a> <span __num="54" __label="true"> (again, no speaking; no confirmation this is post Afghanistan). </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Folks, bottom line: we have to go all the way back to </span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,624975,00.html"> <span __num="56" __label="true"> December 26th 2001 </span> </a> <span __num="57" __label="true"> to see a video of UBL that really seems to get close to passing a smell test evidencing that's he actually, you know, alive (and he didn't look too smashing in it either). </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Now, does anyone seriously believe that UBL wouldn't, if he were alive, be doing his very damnedest to release a tape, soonest, rubbing Bush's nose in it for not having caught him--dead or alive? Just as a little pre-election present, say, maybe to give the opposition a little assist in hyping the disingenous Tora Bora </span> <i> <span __num="59" __label="true"> meme </span> </i> <span __num="60" __label="true"> ? Doubtless, he would, no? Unless, of course, he's dead. Which, I'm beginning to feel pretty comfortable concluding, may well be the happy reality as we sit here today. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> What gives me a little pause? Well, here's one thing. This recent </span> <a href="http://ww3.komotv.com/Global/story.asp?S=2348347"> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Lally Weymouth interview of Pervez Musharraf </span> </a> <span __num="63" __label="true"> . After all, wouldn't the good general be one of the best positioned people, on the planet, to have a pretty good feel for whether UBL is dead or not? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Weymouth: Do you think Osama bin Laden can be captured? We don't know where he is. Is he alive? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> Musharraf: </span> <b> <span __num="66" __label="true"> Most likely, almost certainly </span> </b> <span __num="67" __label="true"> . [emphasis added] </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="68" __label="true"> But then why, in this </span> <a <a="" href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/01/18/gen.war.against.terror/"> <br> <span __num="69" __label="true"> interview </span> </a> <span __num="70" __label="true"> , did Musharraf say: "I think now, frankly, he is dead for the reason he is a ... kidney patient." </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="71" __label="true"> What happened between Lally Weymouth's interview (UBL "almost certainly" alive and the old 2002 interview: "I think now, frankly, he is dead...")? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="72" __label="true"> Well, I don't know, of course. But let me go out on a limb--Musharraf notwithstanding. I think Osama bin Laden is dead. And, if so, you might as well chalk that up, of course, on the positive side of the ledger vis-a-vis Bush's prosecution of the war on terror during his first term. Oh, be sure to think about that the next time you hear hysterical chiming-ons about all those myriad missed opportunities at Tora Bora and such. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="73" __label="true"> Is all the above speculative, circumstantial, merely musings from the 'over here'? Yes, of course. But isn't it all pretty plausible and/or convincing? Sure, I'll have a huge amount of egg on my face should a convincing audio or video of him pop up in the next weeks and months. But, I gotta think, smart money would be betting he's dead rather than alive hunkered down in a back alley in Karachi. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="74" __label="true"> (Um, guess Karl Rove is going to have to come up with a different October surprise...) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="75"> IMPORTANT UPDATE: Particularly if you are in agreement with my argument above--well, don't become </span> <i> <span __num="76"> too </span> </i> <span __num="77"> persuaded until you go read </span> <a href="http://windsofchange.net/archives/005756.php"> <span __num="78"> Dan Darling's near magisterial counter-argument here </span> </a> <span __num="79"> ! </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="80"> Teaser (but be sure to go read his entire post): Dan thinks UBL is sheltering in Iran. I'm skeptical--but Dan's done his homework. </span> </p>
