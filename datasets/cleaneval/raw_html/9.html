      <h3> <span __num="14" __label="true"> the incremental movement toward abolition </span> </h3> 
      <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> Here is some commentary on the question. It's an excerpt from 48 Rutgers LawReview 397, 448-468, ANIMAL RIGHTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE Copyright 1995 byGary L. Francione. Portions of this article are taken from the book RainWithout Thunder. Footnotes are omitted. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> CRITERION #1: An Incremental Change Must Constitute a Prohibition </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="17" __label="true"> ...Thus the first criterion for any incremental change, beyond theincremental education of the public about the need to abolishinstitutionalized animal exploitation, is that it must prohibit somereasonably identifiable behavior. This prohibition must also correlate withthe ability of the animal to claim (through a representative) the protectionof the right. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="18" __label="true"> The requirement that there be a prohibition, and not merely a regulationthat requires "humane" treatment, is sometimes phrased as requiring the"abolition" of a particular practice. Although this is a correct descriptionof the matter, it can cause confusion by equating the abolition ofinstitutionalized animal exploitation with incremental measures that, it ishoped, will lead to that abolition. On the first level of moral theory,animal rights theory is clearly "abolitionist" in that its long-term goal isthe complete eradication of institutionalized animal exploitation. What weare examining now is whether there are adequate criteria that can be used toidentify incremental means to the long-term goal. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> To say that the incremental means must themselves be "abolitionist" iscorrect if the definition includes prohibitions against reasonablyidentifiable conduct which, if engaged in, would constitute a failure torespect a particular animal interest. But these incremental means are bydefinition not "abolitionist" in the sense that no one incrementalprohibition will effect the long-term goal of ending animal slavery. Inorder to avoid confusion, it is better to reserve the use of "abolition" forthe long-term goal of rights theory, and "prohibition" as one criterion ofincremental measures that seek to realize that long-term goal.... </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> CRITERION #2: There Must Be a Prohibition of an Identifiable Activity Thatis Constitutive of the Exploitative Institution </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Consider the following proposals: </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Proposal 1: Reduce the number of hens confined in a battery cage (usuallyfloor space is a twelve inch square) from four hens to three hens. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Proposal 2: Criminalize the use of animals in drug addiction experiments. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="24" __label="true"> These proposals cannot be distinguished using the first criterion alone,because, for the reasons stated above, both of these can be considered toinvolve prohibitions. Although Proposal 2 accords more with the notion of aprohibition, Proposal 1 can be conceptualized as a prohibition on keepingfour chickens in a cage. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> This is not to say, however, that there are no distinctions between Proposal1 and Proposal 2. With respect to the criminalization of the use of animalsin a certain type of experiment, a particular activity that is constitutiveof the general practice of vivisection has been stopped. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> ...[E]ven if the elimination of the battery cage and the substitution of thesmall hen house constitute a prohibition of an activity (i.e., the use ofthe battery cage), that proposal implicates the problem that the changenevertheless continues to sanction the exploitation of the hens, albeit in adifferent form. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> CRITERION #3: The Prohibition of a Constitutive Activity Must Recognize andRespect a Non-Institutional Animal Interest </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Although there is some controversy over whether animals can be said to have"interests," as has been discussed elsewhere, for good reasons, most people,including those who exploit animals, regard nonhumans as having a wide rangeof interests. The law supposedly protects animal interests. The problem isthat for the most part, these interests are those that facilitate theexploitation of animals for a particular property use. For example, the lawprotects the interests of animals used in experiments to the extentnecessary to ensure that the animal produces data of the quality consideredacceptable by research scientists. Indeed, those who support the use ofanimals in experiments assure the public that "only those animals that arecared for properly will be good research subjects," and that the federalAnimal Welfare Act and other sources of regulation provide for the requisitecare. In this sense, each form of institutionalized exploitation will haverules about the "humane" care of animals that are tailored to thatparticular use of animal property and that reflect the particular concernsof that exploitative activity. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> To the extent that we seek the incremental eradication of the propertystatus of animals, it is necessary that there is a corresponding recognitionof the interests of animals in not being regarded as property, or, as Reganwould say, in not being treated exclusively as a means to human ends. ...Toeradicate the property status of animals, there must be a recognition of aninterest that is noninstitutional, or that is not simply an interest thatensures the animal is used "wisely" in a context of exploitation. It is onlythrough recognition of extra or noninstitutional interests that incrementaleradication of property status can be achieved; recognition of institutionalinterests, such as the interest of a turkey destined for slaughter in beingfed, merely reinforces and supports the property status of animals. ... </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="30" __label="true"> CRITERION #4: Animal Interests Cannot Be "Tradable" </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> ...If there is to be an incremental eradication of the property status ofanimals, then there must be a recognition that animals have interests thatgo beyond those interests that must be respected if we are to exploitanimals efficiently. And, following the second salient assumption of animalrights theory, these non-institutional interests cannot be tradable justbecause the aggregation of consequences indicates that the trade isjustified to secure the human "benefit." Indeed, animals are propertyprecisely because animals have no interests (beyond those that must beobserved if the animals are to serve their "purpose" as our property) thatare safe from being balanced away as soon as some human "benefit" isidentified. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> In one sense, this criterion seeks to ensure that the incrementaleradication of property status is indeed an incremental "assembly" ofpersonhood status for nonhumans through the recognition of the inherentvalue of animals. At present, we do not recognize animals as having anyvalue except for their value to us. For example, philosopher Joseph Razclaims that although animals may have some value apart from theirinstrumental use to people, animals cannot have inherent value because anyvalue of the animal ultimately derives from the animal's contribution to thehappiness and well-being of some human or humans, who do have inherentvalue. Raz's views are representative of many people's views. The fourthcriterion ensures that each incremental move provides for and protects somenotion of the inherent value of animals. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> In one sense, this criterion could be said to address the enforceability ofprotection for recognized interests. One could say that under slavery aspracticed in the United States, there were some laws that seemed torecognize that slaves had interests other than ones directly related tokeeping a slave alive and fit for whatever purpose the slave was intended.For the most part, however, these interests were ignored whenever theyconflicted with the interests of the master whose property rights were heldto outweigh the slave's interests. If animal interests are to be takenseriously, then, to the extent that the law regulates the use of animalproperty beyond what is necessary to exploit the animal property, thatregulation must be held as eliminating the property right to the extentnecessary to protect the interest. Otherwise, the victory for animals willbe illusory; as soon as the rights of human property owners are triggered,the animal interest will be ignored. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="34" __label="true"> Accordingly, the interest of the animal must be seen explicitly as aninterest that is to be protected as would a true "right" within the legalsystem. The interest would not be a "right" in the full sense in that sinceanimals would not yet possess the basic right not to be regarded as property(they would still be used for food and in experiments), they would havenonbasic rights that could be said to be building blocks of the basic rightnot to be property. These nonbasic rights must, however, be treated asthough they were rights in the sense that they will be regarded asprotecting interests that are not subject to interest balancing. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="35" __label="true"> To protect animal interests in this manner would require a very deliberateand intentional recognition of a type of legal norm that our legal systemdoes not yet recognize: a norm that functions like a true right in that itrecognizes an interest that cannot be balanced away, but that is held by abeing who has not yet achieved the status of being a holder of the basicright not to be regarded exclusively as a means to an end. Indeed, everytime we recognize such a right, we move away from treating the beingexclusively as a means to human ends; the problem is that the being's mostfundamental interests in not being eaten or used in experiments or kept in azoo have not yet been recognized. These incremental measures may be seen,however, as recognizing pieces of the basic right not to be regarded asproperty. So, although these interests represent nonbasic rights in onesense (the animal does not yet by definition have the basic right of notbeing property), the interests are more properly regarded as "parts" of thebasic right of animals not to be treated exclusively as means to human ends. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> ..In order to recognize that animals have such interests, it is necessarythat these interests be understood as trumping the interests of propertyowners. And in order to be effective, it would be necessary for the legalsystem to recognize that it is animals who hold this interest, and not theirowners or government agencies, such as the USDA, which protects onlythose animal interests that make animals property in the first place. Itwould be necessary to recognize that animals (or, more properlyspeaking, the guardians of animals) have standing to articulate theseinterests against property owners, which would functionally require thatsome sort of guardian be recognized. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Because animals are regarded as property, and property is, by definition andseveral hundred years of accepted understanding, that which cannot havelegal relations with persons or other property, courts have developeddoctrines that preclude animals or their surrogates from articulating theirinterests in courts of law and before regulatory agencies. This exclusion isbased on the supposed inability (in terms of the power of the court) toadjudicate claims made by property or those who purport to represent thatproperty. So, if the ... non-institutional interests of animals are to benon-tradable, then those interests, which must be seen as recognizing"minitrumps" of the property rights of animal owners, must be protected bythe legal system. This will require that animal interests have legalstanding and that some human actor (and this could be the police) havestanding to articulate those claims before the appropriate body. This is, ofcourse, not a new idea. In Should Trees Have Standing? -- Toward LegalRights for Natural Objects, Christopher Stone argued that the inherent valueof nonhumans could be recognized and protected by guardians just as are therights (basic rights and nonbasic rights) of children or the mentallydisabled. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="38" __label="true"> CRITERION #5: The Prohibition Should Not Substitute an Alternative, andSupposedly More "Humane" Form of Exploitation </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="39" __label="true"> This fifth criterion follows from both aspects of rights theory identifiedat the outset of this section: that rights theory requires eradication ofthe property status of animals and that the right of animals not to beregarded as property cannot be compromised for consequential reasons. Inmany respects, this fifth criterion is the most significant of the groupbecause it often will be the most helpful in determining whether a proposedincremental measure is consistent with rights theory, although, like theother criteria, this one is not exact and will not provide an easy answer inall cases. But then, the idea is to try to make a morally informed decision,and not necessarily one that is always right. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="40" __label="true"> The fifth criterion holds that it is inconsistent with rights theory totreat some animals exclusively as means to the ends of others, or asproperty, in order to secure some benefit that it is hoped will eventuallysecure a higher moral status for other animals. This is a serious problemfor the new welfarist who purports to endorse the long-term goal of animalrights by using short-term welfarist reforms as a means to the end ofabolition of institutionalized exploitation. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="41" __label="true"> The new welfarist disregards the inherent value of some animals in order tosecure a benefit for other animals. For example, the federal Animal WelfareAct provides that animals may be used in biomedical experiments as long astheir use is "humane" and they are not forced to suffer "unnecessarily." Thenew welfarists, who supported the 1985 amendments to the Act, believe thatthe Act will itself reduce animal suffering, but more importantly, that lawslike the Act are "stepping stones" to the future recognition and respect ofanimals other than the ones whose interests are now being ignored. ThisArticle argued earlier that there is simply no way to determine whether lawslike the Act actually reduce animal suffering, and that, given thestructural defects of welfare theory generally, such laws will generally beheld only to require that conduct that facilitates the use of the animal asproperty. Apart from the rather puzzling logic of how we get to anon-property status of animals by persistent reinforcement of the propertyparadigm, there is something objectionable on a theoretical level when arights advocate explicitly endorses the property status of animals as a wayof eradicating that status on an incremental basis. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="42" __label="true"> ...So, for example, a complete prohibition on the use of chimpanzees incertain procedures can reasonably be said to constitute the prohibition of aconstitutive activity, but to the extent that the advocate urges or acceptsthat other animals, such as dogs, should be used instead...such a rule wouldviolate the fundamental proscription against speciesism. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> In order to understand more fully the point of this fifth criterion,consider the following example: animal advocates propose to lobby for a lawthe preamble of which explicitly recognizes that animals have moralinterests and the current configuration of battery hens per cage disrespectsthose moral interests. The body of the law provides that in recognition ofthe interests that hens have, no more than two shall be placed in batterycages, and these cages shall be enlarged to provide 196 inches of floorspacerather than 144 inches. The egg industry objects to this arrangementvehemently as it is "unnecessary" to maximize the value of animal propertyand will, in fact, impose a very significant cost on the ownership of animalproperty in this context. The law provides that this interest must beprotected irrespective of the economic consequences and contains penaltiesto ensure that the interests are not recognized subject to completedefeasance through a claim of human "benefit." </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> The traditional welfarist would undoubtedly support this measure because itwill, in the welfarist's view, reduce animal suffering. The new welfarist,who seeks as a long-term goal the abolition of animal exploitation, willalso undoubtedly support this, not only because it will supposedly reducesuffering, but because it is a "stepping stone" or "springboard" intoabolition at some future time. The new welfarist and the traditionalwelfarist have the same view -- that the measure will reduce suffering --but the new welfarist, unlike the traditional welfarist, believes thatbecause the measure will reduce suffering, it will act as an incrementalmeasure on the road to the long-term goal. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> The animal rights advocate first dismisses the view that avoiding pain andsuffering are the only interests that animals (human or nonhuman) have. Ifpain and suffering were the only relevant moral interests, then what wouldprevent us from using small numbers of "undesirable" humans to eradicatelarge amounts of human pain and suffering? Obviously, although we all havestrong interests in avoiding pain and suffering, we do limit the ways inwhich pain and suffering can be alleviated so as to respect otherinterests -- such as the rights of humans (and nonhumans) -- as well.Second, the rights advocate dismisses the new welfarist view, alsoarticulated by Singer, that a measure that reduces pain and suffering willlead to incremental achievement of the long-term goal of equal considerationfor equal interests (Singer) or the abolition of all institutionalizedexploitation (Regan) simply because it supposedly reduces pain andsuffering. The rights advocate knows that some measures that supposedlyreduce pain and suffering will do nothing more than assure that animalsreceive protection that is consistent with their status as property, andthat facilitates their use as particular types of property. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="46" __label="true"> The rights advocate begins by asking whether the proposal contains aprohibition or a regulation, and concludes that the proposal prohibitskeeping more than two hens in the cage. She is unclear as to whether, evenif the proposal is a prohibition, it constitutes a prohibition of anactivity that is constitutive of the overall form of exploitation. She errsin favor of regarding the measure as prohibiting a constitutive activity.She is clear, however, that the proposal provides for the recognition of aninterest that is extra-institutional in that it provides for the recognitionof an interest that is not tied to the property status of the hens. Theproposal recognizes that the hens have inherent value beyond their status asproperty, which would justify only that level of regulation that facilitatedanimal use. Moreover, the proposal provides that these interests cannot betraded away and constitute proto-rights. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> The problem with the proposal is that it is, on its face, not onlyconsistent with the status of animals as property that, as a general matter,lacks inherent value, but does so in a way that explicitly trades away thebasic right of the hens not to be property in favor of a recognition ofmoral status that falls short of recognition of the basic right, or thecomplete protection of some interest that the animal has in, for example,bodily movement. By agreeing to the two-hen arrangement, animal advocatesare trying to achieve proto-rights while at the same time endorsing analternative form of exploitation -- two hens in a cage -- that is supposedlymore "humane." </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> In the present case, it seems reasonable to say that the interest involvedis the interest that the hens have -- all of them -- in not being in thebattery cage in the first place and in having freedom of movement that isappropriate to the species. To the extent that the proposal recognizes andrespects that interest, then the prohibition arguably does not substituteanother form of exploitation and is acceptable. That is, assume that aprohibition abolishes the battery cage entirely and replaces it with arearing system that accommodates all of the hen's interests in freedom ofmovement and thereby fully recognizes the interest of the hen's bodilyintegrity. Such a state of affairs may be another way of saying that theprohibition ends a particular form of exploitation that has violated aparticular non-institutional, non-tradable interest that we have now decidedto respect. But this sort of substitution differs considerably from merelyremoving two of the hens from the cage in that although we have not yetabolished the institutionalized exploitation, the substitution eliminatesthe exploitation involved in the confinement system through a fullrecognition of the interest of the hens in their freedom of movement. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="49" __label="true"> In any event, any substitution of exploitation raises serious questions forthe rights advocate. If the incremental eradication of the property statusof animals is going to be consistent with rights theory, it is importantthat proposed measures not substitute one form of exploitation for another,supposedly more "humane" form of exploitation. Oftentimes, the alternativeform of exploitation will provide in general terms for "humane" treatment,which then feeds the whole matter right back through the mechanisms of legalwelfarism which, as argued before, are structurally defective andsystematically devalue animal interests. But even if the substitute form ofexploitation is more definite (i.e., there shall be no more than two birdsper cage), and even if the proposal recognizes that the animals have someinherent value that justifies the recognition of a non-institutional,non-tradable interest, that recognition comes at the expense of endorsinganother form of exploitation that rests on the legitimacy of the status ofanimals as property. This sacrifices the moral right of the animal not to beproperty for a proto-right that is designed to effect the incrementaleradication of property status. The substitution of exploitation raisesissues of moral conflict with rights theory, and incoherence in light of thefundamental assumptions of that theory. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> This discussion does serve, however, to demonstrate that as a practicalmatter, certain campaigns will be difficult for animal rights advocates topursue if they agree with this fifth criterion. It seems that the rightsadvocate really has no choice but to condemn any form of substituteexploitation, unless that alternative arrangement completely eradicates anactivity constitutive of animal exploitation through the full recognition ofrelevant animal interests. The animal advocate must not herself suggest analternative, and must not agree to any alternative offered by the exploiter.To do either would involve the rights advocate sacrificing the basic rightof animals not to be property in order to secure a less-than-basicproto-right that, while it does recognize and respect that animals haveperson-like interests that transcend their status as property, is achievedat the cost of reinforcing the notion that a "better" system of animalslavery is acceptable. These considerations would militate in favor ofconducting the sort of campaign that may not succeed (at least initially),but that will have a potentially powerful effect on educating members of thepublic about animal exploitation. And in many respects, such education,whether sought directly in the classroom or as part of a militant campaignsuch as one that supports a law to demand the end of the egg battery andthat urges no substitute form of exploitation (rather than a reactionary andconservative welfarist campaign to make the matters more "humane" for thehens) is probably the best thing that the animal rights advocate can do atthis stage of history in any event. </span> </p> 
      <!-- <h3>Animal Rights - not Animal Welfare</h3> --> 
      <!--<h4>An introduction to the trojan horse phenomenon in the AR movememnt.</h4> --> 
      <!--<H3>Animal rights vs. Animal Welfare - An introductionto the Controversy</H3><H4><I>by Dietrich von Haugwitz</I></H4>Many people who have only recently joined the Animal Rights/Animal ProtectionMovement are puzzled why one issue seems to stir up a never-ending debate&nbsp;within the movement.&nbsp; The following is designed to acquaint the readerwith the reasons why "animal rights" and "animal welfare" are two verydifferent concepts, even though they both concern the well being of animals.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In most counties throughout the U.S. we find organizations with nameslike Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Animal ProtectionSociety (APS) and Humane Society (HS).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>These should be viewed as "animal welfare" organizations.&nbsp; Astheir names indicate, they are concerned with cruelty, with protection,with humane treatment.&nbsp; And typically, their concern is for domesticanimals:<BR>chiefly dogs and cats, but also horses, goats, rabbits, etc.<P>The welfarist accepts certain traditional attitudes toward animals:These are our animals; we own them, and we should be responsible owners.&nbsp;Like a good shepherd, we should look after those in our charge; protectthem; treat them humanely.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>But for the welfarist there is a fundamental difference between animalsand people.&nbsp; People have rights, but with each such right come someobligations.&nbsp; (I have a right to be protected from theft; but in turnI have an obligation not to steal.)&nbsp; Animals can't reason; they can'tunderstand obligations, and so it would be absurd to give them rights.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(Note that animal protection laws do NOT create legal rights for animals.&nbsp;In the eyes of the law, animals are not "legal persons", they are property.&nbsp;If I kill your dog, in the eyes of the law I have harmed YOU, not yourdog.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Animal welfare people accept this property status of animals.&nbsp;Still, they differ widely on how much welfare animals are entitled to.&nbsp;Even the cattle rancher, circus owner, or vivisector claims to be greatlyconcerned with the welfare of his or her animals: "We avoid all unnecessarypain and suffering; we observe the Humane Slaughter Act and the AnimalWelfare Act; and we truly care for our animals - or else they wouldn'tyield good meat, perform well in the circus, or yield good results in research."&nbsp;Whereas animal-loving people in humane societies go much farther: theysee lots of unnecessary suffering in all those industries: Those layinghens should be free running; those circus elephants are hurt during training;and using those lab rabbits is unnecessary because safe cosmetics (unlikemedical discoveries) can be obtained without animals.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>For welfarists the bottom line is: We are opposed to cruelty;&nbsp;we owe the animals kindness and compassion.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>How does that differ from the animal rights view?&nbsp; The differenceis fundamental.&nbsp; AR says: Kindness and compassion?&nbsp; That's allvery nice, but it misses the point.&nbsp; What we owe the animals is somethingquite different:&nbsp; We owe them RESPECT and JUSTICE !&nbsp; (Put yourselfback into, say, the year 1830.&nbsp; There were the welfarist: We musttreat our slaves with great kindness and compassion.&nbsp; Nonsense!, saidthe Abolitionists;<BR>we must liberate them!&nbsp; Even if their lives might sometimes becomeeven harder, we must recognize that the entire institution is utterly immoraland must be abolished.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In this short overview, we cannot get into the philosophical differencebetween the utilitarian AR view (Singer) and the strict rights view (Regan,Rollin, ...).&nbsp; But both theories arrive essentially at the same bottomline:&nbsp; The traditional line drawn between one species (human) andall other species is irrational when it comes to morals.&nbsp; Speciesmembership is not morally relevant.&nbsp; We must give equal considerationto the interests of all sentient animals, regardless of species.&nbsp;Not to do so rests on nothing more than tradition.&nbsp; Animal rightstheorists<BR>have advanced arguments that are very hard to refute; they show whyall differences between humans and non-humans - great as they may be! -are morally irrelevant.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Therefore, animals must not be viewed as ours.&nbsp; They do not existfor us. They are not our commodities, harvests, stock, game, objects ofamusement or education, specimens, or throw-away lab tools like rubber<BR>gloves or test tubes.&nbsp; To regard them as our property, and toencode this property status in our laws, is a case of "might makes right"-- no more.&nbsp; It cannot be morally justified.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>As Regan points out, if humans have "independent value" (and most ofus accept that), then so do chimpanzees.&nbsp; To deny this would be irrational.If something has "instrumental value", it may be used as a tool, for ourbenefit.&nbsp; But individuals who have independent value must not be usedas if they&nbsp; were instruments.&nbsp; (Hence the abolition of humanslavery.)&nbsp; We must respect their rights not to be enslaved for ourbenefit.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>So when we say that animals have some very basic rights (such as life,liberty, and the pursuit of their happiness), we are talking of MORAL rights.&nbsp;Before each of our existing legal rights were established, a<BR>majority of people had felt strongly that a moral right existed. Campaignersworked for the rights of racial minorities, of women, of children.&nbsp;Animal rights campaigners now work for translating the moral<BR>rights of animals into legal rights.<P>So in the AR view, all institutions which enslave animals must be abolished!&nbsp;&nbsp;That's an incredibly radical idea. It differs fundamentally from any versionof the animal welfare or protection view.&nbsp; While animal welfare peoplework for improvements of the conditions in which animals are kept, animalrights people challenge the right of owners to keep such animals.&nbsp;One AR motto: We do not demand larger and cleaner cages; we demand emptycages!<BR>&nbsp;<BR>How to achieve this abolition?&nbsp; That's where there are very seriousdifferences with in the AR community, and they are appropriate topics forinternal debates.&nbsp; Should the emphasis be on legislative actions?On education? On confrontations and "direct action"? Should we supportthe Animal Liberation Front (ALF) ?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>But another quarrel between two factions in the AR movement concernsthis:&nbsp; Should we work with welfare people on reforms?&nbsp; Some say:by all means!&nbsp; Let's strengthen the Animal Welfare Act;&nbsp; let'smake the animal<BR>care committees' minutes public; let's support the downers bill (collapsedanimals should not be dragged to slaughter); let's get rid of face brandingcattle; etc.&nbsp; NO!, says the other side.&nbsp; Reforms only legitimatethe exploiting industries; abolition will be much harder if the worst excessesare legally removed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>To sum up:&nbsp; Each of us should search his or her soul as to whatthe ultimate goal of our activities should be.&nbsp; Undoubtedly many animalrightists will often work together with animal welfare people and withenvironmental groups on certain efforts.&nbsp; But we should give a certainstructure to our own beliefs and convictions.&nbsp; Do we just want tohelp animals here and there (perhaps because we are "animal lovers")? Obviouslythere is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; But if we want to commit ourselvesto this hard work, we will have to make up our minds about our ultimateintent:&nbsp; reform or abolition? -->
