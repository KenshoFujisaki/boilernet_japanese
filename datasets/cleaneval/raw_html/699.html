    <big> <big> <big> <span __num="43" __label="true"> How Killing Workers Goes Unpunished </span> </big> </big> </big> 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> "Workers decapitated on assemblylines, shredded in machinery, burnedbeyond recognition, electrocuted, buried alive -- all of them killed,investigators concluded, because their employers willfully violatedworkplace safety laws." </span> </span> 
    <br style="font-style: italic;"> 
    <br> 
    <span __num="45" __label="true"> Is that a description of avoidable workplace fatalities in China?&nbsp;No, this is a scandal made in the USA. The deaths happen here at therate of 100workers a year as a result of "intentional wrongdoing or plainindifference" by employers. And, despite U.S. respect for the rule oflaw, theoffending employers are almost never prosecuted. </span> 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <span __num="46" __label="true"> Those are among the startling findings of an intensive </span> 
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> <span __num="47" __label="true"> New York Times </span> </span> 
    <span __num="48" __label="true"> investigation thatresulted in what the </span> 
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Times </span> </span> 
    <span __num="50" __label="true"> calls"the first systematic accounting of how this nation confrontsemployers who kill workers by deliberately violating workplace safetylaws." A few of the other findings disclosed in a December 22 articleby David Barstow: </span> 
    <br> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Although causing the death of a worker by willfully violatingU.S. occupational safety laws is a federal crime, from 1982 to 2002 thefederalOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) declined to seekprosecutions in 93% of the cases in which the agency itself concludedthat the workers had died because of "willful" safetyviolations by employers. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Moreover, repeat offenders got off easy. "Having avoidedprosecution once, at least 70 employers willfully violated safety lawsagain, resulting in scores of additional deaths. Even these repeatviolators were rarely prosecuted," Barstow writes. </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="53" __label="true"> In the OSHA bureaucracy "victims' families are frozen out, butcompanies adeptly work the rules in their favor." Since 1990 OSHA hasincreasingly bowed "to employer demands that it replace the word'willful' with 'unclassified' in citations involving workplacedeaths...even for employers who have repeatedly shown a deliberatedisregard for safety laws, resulting in multiple deaths." </span> </li> 
     <li> <span __num="54" __label="true"> In two decades OSHA's enforcement of the law has led to jailsentences totaling fewer than 30 years. In a single year, 2001, theEnvironmental Protection Agency obtained prison sentences totaling 256years. </span> <br> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <span __num="55" __label="true"> Barstow's article, part of a series, "When Workers Die," on how theU.S. government deals with the worst cases of death on the job, issubtitled"A Culture of Reluctance."&nbsp; That's an understatement. It is aculture of cruel indifference and criminal malfeasance. </span>
