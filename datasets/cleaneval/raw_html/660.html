      <blockquote> 
       <p> <span __num="10" __label="true"> Ok, now we understand why </span> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5844164528551586/"> <span __num="11" __label="true"> TiVo CEO Michael Ramsay </span> </a> <span __num="12" __label="true"> was </span> <q> <span __num="13" __label="true"> promoted </span> </q> <span __num="14" __label="true"> out of his job last week. You know how people have been telling TiVohow the only way theyâ€™re going to survive would be to convince some acable company to license their digital video recorder software for useon set-top boxes? Yeah, well according to the New York Times lastsummer they were about to score a big deal with Comcast to do preciselythis, that is until Ramsay pulled the plug at the last moment becausehe was convinced TiVo wasnâ€™t getting paid enough money or given enoughcontrol over the service. </span> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> Remember how DirecTV accounts for 2,000,000 of TiVo's 3,000,000customers and TiVo lost that relationship?&nbsp; TiVo was negotiating withComcast last summer and offered less than the $1/month that they getfrom DirecTV, so Michael Ramsay decided to walk away. </span> <br> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> Now it's easy to play Monday morning quarterback in situations likethis, but hasn't a big cable company deal been the dream all along? And in spite of sub-dollar monthly fees, couldn't the </span> <a href="http://www.tivo.com/5.3.1.1.asp?article=235"> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Tahiti strategy </span> </a> <span __num="18" __label="true"> be an alternate revenue source for those customers? </span> <br> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="19" __label="true"> To be fair, if the Comcast deal had been inked and then TiVo wasprevented from introducing innovative products because of their threatto the cable companies we'd all be screaming bloody murder.&nbsp; It'spossible (note that word, this is pure speculation) that there was anon-negotiable clause that said something like "Non-Comcast video willnot be available on the TiVo" which would have nixed any of the futureplans like partnering with content providers. </span> <br> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> When the story of TiVo is written, this Comcast negotiation could be the point when the company's outcome was decided. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Wow, if this is true, it is rather upsetting. Once you walk away from an opportunity like that they generally are gone for good. Even if they would've gotten very little from the deal, it would've put 'TiVo' into many homes, and kept some *other* solution *out*. Which is perhaps more important. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> TiVo has said they can survive without DirecTV because the overall financial benefit of the deal isn't really that large a part of their income, but it is still income and my understanding is it is still a profitable business. So it is upside. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="35" __label="true"> Agreed they walked away from a deal. But Comcast probably gave the lowball offer in a attempt to work from the bottom up on price.

Tivo's features are better. Sorry, but you will never be able to pry my Tivo from my hands. Not even after I'm dead. The best possible solution? Comcast inks a deal with Tivo. Once you use Tivo, I think you will feel the same way I do. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> While TiVo has made many mistakes strategically (Thomas does a good job outlining them on his site), as much as it pains me to say, I dont think walking away from Comcast was one of them. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> DirecTV's decision not to support HMO / TTG, etc. provides a good indication of what a Comcast relationship would have been like - restrictive, half-fast and ultimately detrimental to the TiVo brand. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> Starting in 2006, the landscape is going to be reset - TiVo will be able to offer a single solution which supports native digital signal capture (via CableCard), dual tuners (at least), and HD. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="68" __label="true"> TiVo will probably always be the higher-cost provider given the service providers deeper pockets, ability to bundle and better marketing / distribution economics, but TiVo should be able to get creative and discount based on the consumer signing a long-term deal, etc. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> TiVo being forced to go direct might be best not only for the company, but the for the consumer. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> TiVo is going to have to out innovate, and out-develop its competitors in the form of more functionality, etc. to compete. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="74" __label="true"> Personally, I've caused the placement of 4 tivos into others homes, severely influenced another 2. Only 1 of them was directv. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="75" __label="true"> DirecTV WILL have HMO, the current R10 boxes have the screens, there are many posts on tivocommunity. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="76" __label="true"> A co-worker just received a plasma hdtv, signed up for comcast HD, got their new HD box. He absolutely hates it, (the comcast box), he complains _every day_ it locks, up, doesn't record his shows, is hard to use. He sums it up as "it's not TIVO". </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="77" __label="true"> Another coworker received TIVO for xmas, just installed it this weekend. His biggest complaint was setup. If it wasn't from his daughter and a wireless modem jack investment, it would have gone back he said. He missed antenna vs cable in the setup and misunderstood he needed to wipe the box and start over. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="78" __label="true"> After 1 day he was digging the pause, replay and rewind. Will see if he watched the news in 7 minutes tomorrow. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="79" __label="true"> Less than a $1.00 a viewer, TIVO makes 12 times that now with individual boxes, I think their sales were higher than expected for the holidays. Tivo was number # 11 top selling merchandise on Amazon a couple of times. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="80" __label="true"> TIVO needs to go on QVC once a month, they'd sell 10,000 units in an hour. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="81" __label="true"> I believe their losses are the research on HD unit, the cable card unit, the development of the TIVOtoGO. The comparison to Apple is sound, how will TIVO be with 500,000 stand along subscribers at the end of this year? likely double next year. Every celebrity has a TIVO, Oprah gives them away, Ellen gives them away. </span> </p>

He's gotten a ton of calls, and escalated up to his manager's manager, and no one inside of the direcTV tech support department knows anything about them cancelling support. He says they will always support it. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="86" __label="true"> He also claimed to have a personal stake in it, because he loves his TiVo. :) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="87" __label="true"> So, don't worry about DirecTiVos becoming obsolete -- you've probably got until at least the end of 2007 to continue using it, and by then you'll probably need to upgrade anyway in order to be in compliance with the government's latest 'anti-piracy' flag that they'll be adding to broadcast streams. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="109" __label="true"> There aren't any simple answers to Tivo's problems. The fact of the matter is that cable providers are in the drivers seat when it comes to interactive TV, and they're very good at ensuring they remain so. As the NYT article notes, look at who has fallen by the wayside (Liberate, OpenTV). There is just no way a cable company is going to lose control of their business, or be beholden to a technology partner. If that means crappy service (and it does), or glacial innovation (and it does), so be it. They have no problem stonewalling and just watching ITV companies wither and die. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="132" __label="true"> Motorola Acquires Ucentric Systems, Extending the Seamless Mobility of Digital Video Entertainment through the Home </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="133" __label="true"> HORSHAM, Pa. - 18 January 2005 â€” Motorola, Inc. (NYSE: MOT) today announced that the company has acquired privately-held Ucentric Systems, Inc., a leading provider of home media networking software for the connected home. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="134" __label="true"> This strategic acquisition enables Motorola to actively market connected home software solutions to third party service providers and consumer electronics manufacturers. A leader in end-to-end broadband technologies, Motorola will leverage its global brand presence and worldwide resources to grow Ucentric's existing customer base. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> The Ucentric software solution provides seamless access to stored digital entertainment - such as high-definition video on a DVR, music on a computer hard drive, or pictures on a laptop - from any connected device in the home. The software is designed to operate with electronic program guides from multiple vendors, and service providers can customize the interface with applications that personalize the subscriber experience. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> Additionally, Motorola will make the software available as part of its Home Media Architecture solution for the company's advanced and basic digital set-top platforms. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="137" __label="true"> "Motorola is committed to bringing relevant seamless mobility solutions to the connected home marketplace, and the acquisition of Ucentric's suite provides us with a robust software platform for delivering the next generation of broadband services. Customers can leverage these new tools in our portfolio to deliver new levels of personalized entertainment and communication to devices in and around the home," said John Burke, Motorola corporate vice president and general manager, consumer entertainment solutions. </span> <br> <span __num="138"> ============== </span> <br> <span __num="139" __label="true"> Ucentric announced a licensing agreement with DIRECTV, Inc. at CES 2005, the nation's leading and fastest growing digital television service provider, to deploy its Home Media Center software platform. The new DIRECTV Home Media Center will be comprised of a main unit, with smaller units located at each additional TV networked throughout the house, to provide DIRECTV customers with digital video recorder (DVR) service on all television sets. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="142" __label="true"> I don't know which is sadder, the fact that TiVo missed the boat here or that Comcast is such a gorilla, a simple deal gone bad can potentially break a company. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="143" __label="true"> You could say that Comcast doesn't need TiVo... No one chooses their television service based on the beauty of interface design or how they access their programs. However, moving forward, it's all about keeping up with and/or copying the things that TiVo has introduced to make watching TV that much more of a pleasure. Combined with the fact that as a traditional cable company, Comcast, and others, are behind the eight ball in how they develop and deploy new technology, compared to a traditional consumer electronics company. So in that regard, they do need TiVo... and I guess it's just a matter of time until they take that over as well. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="156" __label="true"> I bought a ReplayTV 3 years ago and dearly love it, as does my wife. Not quite a TiVo like I recommended to my brother-in-law, but it was cheap at the time and we love the auto-commercial skip. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="157" __label="true"> But, when our old TV finally went belly up we bought a Phillips CRT HDTV at CostCo, thinking we need to be ready for the future. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="158" __label="true"> Then, of course, to get value out of it we ordered HD service with the DVR from Comcast, figuring to pay Comcast the $9.95/month we were paying ReplayTV -- a wash. Of course the HD service was $5, and... to get ESPN HD and TNT HD we needed to upgrade to digital cable as well. So my cable bill goes up $30/month and my Replay bill goes down $10. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="159" __label="true"> The DVR is Scientific Atlanta 8300 HD, and it amazes me how inferior the interface is compared to a 3-year old box from the second best DVR company. My wife begged for her ReplayTV back, and even started watching tennis in the back room on my crappy 19" set, which has the ReplayTV for the moment. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> That is, until we watched the US Open Tennis final on the comcast DVR in 16:9 HD. Beautiful, we just had to do a lot of (rather slow) fast forwarding. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="161" __label="true"> If and when TiVo comes out with the dual tuner HD cablecard machine discussed here, and if it can replace what comcast gave me I will seriously consider it -- but I doubt the new users of the comcast box will, because if the SA 8300 HD is all you have ever seen it will probably seem good enough. </span> </p>
