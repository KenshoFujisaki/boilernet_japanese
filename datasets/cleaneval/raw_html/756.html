                <span __num="31" __label="true"> This exercise is designed to see Aura for the first time and/or practice seeing Auras. Choosing good conditions is important: not only you see the Aura better, but also to gain a confidence about what you see. </span> 
                <ol> 
                 <li> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Situate the person in front of a very softly illuminated PLAIN WHITE background. A color background will change Aura colors, so you need additional knowledge about combining colors. Some combinations of background and Aura colors may cause misinterpretation problems. </span> <br> </li> 
                 <li> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Choose ONE SPOT to look at. The middle of the forehead is VERY GOOD. This is a location of so called Brow Chakra or the Third Eye. In some cultures (India) they put a mark on a forehead. Such a mark in ancient times could mean the invitation to look and see the Aura. </span> <br> </li> 
                 <li> <span __num="34" __label="true"> Look at this spot for 30 to 60 seconds or longer </span> <br> </li>

This is your own perception of the Aura. The longer you concentrate, the better you will see it.

You have only one second or two until your photosensitive cells will stop vibrating and sending visual sensations to the brain. And if you miss is, you have to start concentrating again. Try to experiment how fast or slow you should close your eyes. </span>

                <p class="text"> <strong> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Observing auras of other people </span> <br> </strong> <br> <span __num="41" __label="true"> The best is to look directly at someone's brow chakra (third eye or wisdom eye, which is located @1.5 cm above the nose, between eyes) and aim to achieve the state of mind similar to the concentration technique described above for at least 30-60 seconds. I have tried also looking at throat and heart chakras with similar results. However, if you concentrate on someone's chest it looks so unusual that the person concerned is usually very uneasy about it. When you look into someone's brow chakra you can actually continue conversation. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Again, VERY softly illuminated background, with no shadows is best. With practice, any uniformly illuminated background (such as a blue sky for example) will suffice. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="43" __label="true"> How to see your own Aura </span> </strong> <br> <br> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Stand about 1.5 m in front of a good size mirror. In the beginning it is best if the background behind you is plain white and there are no shadows. Illumination should be VERY soft and uniform not bright. Follow instructions above for seeing Auras. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="45" __label="true"> PRACTICE for at least 10-15 minutes each day to increase your sensitivity and develop Auric sight. Remember that practice is required to develop Auric sight. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="46" __label="true"> Auric sight and after-images </span> </strong> <br> <br> <span __num="47" __label="true"> One of the most frequently asked questions during my workshops is: "Tom, are my eyes playing tricks on me ?" The answer is no, you have just learnt to pay attention to what your eyes are capable of. Light sensors in our eyes (Red Green and Blue) are vibration sensors which are highly non-linear and they have memory. The consequence of memory is that they can oscillate for up to several seconds after the visual stimulation has been discontinued. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="48" __label="true"> This memory of visual stimulation is frequently perceived as afterimage. Afterimages have a precisely the same shape as original images. Afterimage of an object surrounded by its Aura is larger than the original image. The increase in such afterimage is due to the vibration of an Aura and actually represents a "snapshot" of an Aura. It is therefore essential to focus at one spot when watching the Aura and resist temptation to change the point of focus, otherwise an image of the Aura may become confused with the afterimage of an object. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Meaning of Aura and its colors </span> </strong> <br> <br> <span __num="50" __label="true"> The Aura is a reflection of our True Nature at any given moment. At this point it is perhaps necessary to explain what do I mean by "True Nature" and why some effort is necessary to "discover" it. Our society seems to emphasize symbols, stereotypes, habits, manners, superficial behavior, pretending, following others and submitting free will to some "leaders". Our "education" seems to be based on views and expectations of people who try to control the flock. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Our True Nature is what is left when we recognize and discard all our habits, stereotypes, manners, and pretending, superficial behavior and become fully conscious, truly natural and spontaneous. Note that some people are so attached to their manners and habits that it is very hard, if not impossible, to discover who they really are. The only way to get an instant insight into their personality seems to be by watching their Aura, because the Aura shows their True Nature, behind any facade of superficial behavior. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="52" __label="true"> In general, the more colorful, cleaner and brighter the Aura, the better and more spiritually advanced is the person. Also, the more uniform the energy distribution in the Aura, the healthier and more balanced the person is. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="53" __label="true"> Distribution of the energy in the Aura seems to have the potential of a </span> <a href="http://kirlianresearch.com" target="_blank"> <span __num="54" __label="true"> powerful medical diagnostic tool </span> </a> <span __num="55" __label="true"> , but usually requires using a complex equipment. The scope of this article is to concentrate on what we can easily see with our eyes. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Our Aura surrounds the entire body, but the interpretation of colors below relates to the Aura around the head only. Meaning of colors around the head presented below suggested in the literature has been confirmed by the author. When you learn to see Aura well, you can verify it for yourself, by concentrating on certain thoughts while watching your Aura, or telling people what their thoughts are when you see their Auras. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="57" __label="true"> Usually, people have one or two dominating colors (strong points) in their Aura. These colors (or their Auric pairs) will be most likely their favorite colors. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="58" __label="true"> In addition to dominant colors, the Aura reflects thoughts, feelings and desires, which appear like "flashes", "clouds" or "flames", usually further away from the head. For example a flash of orange in the Aura indicates a thought or desire to exercise power and control. Orange as a dominant color is a sign of power and general ability to control people. Quickly changing "flashes" indicate quickly changing thoughts. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="59" __label="true"> Meaning of Clean Colors of the Aura </span> <br> <span __num="60" __label="true"> (colors of the rainbow, bright, shiny, monochromatic colors): </span> </strong> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Purple: </span> </strong> <span __num="62" __label="true"> indicates spiritual thoughts. Purple is never a strong point in the Aura. It appears only as temporary "clouds" and "flames", indicating truly spiritual thoughts. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="63" __label="true"> Blue: </span> </strong> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive. They are born survivors. Blue thought is a thought about relaxing the nerve system to achieve the balance of the mind or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override any other color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel Desmarquet, author of " </span> <a href="mic.htm" target="_blank"> <span __num="65" __label="true"> Thiaoouba Prophecy </span> </a> <span __num="66" __label="true"> ", frequently glows with the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers questions from the public. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="67" __label="true"> Turquoise: </span> </strong> <span __num="68" __label="true"> indicates dynamic quality of being, highly energized personality, capable of projection, influencing other people. People with turquoise strong point in their Aura can do many things simultaneously and are good organizers. They feel bored when forced to concentrate on one thing. People love bosses with turquoise Auras, because such bosses explain their goals and influence their team rather than demand executing their commands. Turquoise thought is a thought about organizing and influencing others. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="69" __label="true"> Green: </span> </strong> <span __num="70" __label="true"> restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in their Auras are natural healers. The stronger the green Aura, the better the healer. They also love gardening and usually have a "green hand" - anything grows for them. Being in a presence of a person with a strong and green Aura is a very peaceful and restful experience. Green thought indicates a restful state and healing. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="71" __label="true"> Yellow: </span> </strong> <span __num="72" __label="true"> joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous and not attached to anything. Yellow halo around the head: high spiritual development. A signature of a spiritual teacher. Do not accept spiritual teachings from anyone who does not have such a yellow halo. Buddha and Christ had yellow halos extending to their arms. Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate the brow chakra continuously for many years, because they always have intensive spiritual thoughts in their minds. When this chakra is observed when highly active, a yellow (Auric pair) halo appears around it, surrounding the entire head. Yellow thought indicates a moment of joy and contentment. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="73" __label="true"> Orange: </span> </strong> <span __num="74" __label="true"> uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power. Ability and/or desire to control people. When orange becomes a strong point, it usually contributes to a yellow halo, which then becomes gold, indicating not only a spiritual teacher, but a powerful spiritual teacher, someone capable of demonstrating his/her unique abilities. Orange thought is a thought about exercising power or a desire to control people. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="75" __label="true"> Red: </span> </strong> <span __num="76" __label="true"> materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body. Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="77" __label="true"> Pink </span> </strong> <span __num="78" __label="true"> (=purple+red): love (in a spiritual sense). To obtain a clean pink, you need to mix the purple (the highest frequency we perceive) with red (the lowest frequency). Pink Aura indicates that the person achieved a perfect balance between spiritual awareness and the material existence. The most advanced people have not only a yellow halo around the head (a permanent strong point in the Aura) but also a large pink Aura extending further away. The pink color in the Aura is quite rare on Earth and appears only as a temporary thought, never as a strong point in the Aura. </span> </p>

Why does the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like a noise, rather than a set of harmonious tones (monochromatic colors). It is impossible to "tune" the noise to an orchestra playing harmonious music, hence the white Aura indicates a lack of harmony in the body and mind. Nature, which we are a part of, is harmonious. This harmony comes in discrete vibration "tones" or harmonics, partially described by the modern quantum physics. </span> <br> <span __num="89" __label="true"> Several hours before the death, the Aura becomes white, and greatly increases in intensity. For this reason in most cultures "death" is depicted in WHITE (not black), because in the past, people could actually see a white Aura before death. It seems that our ancestors knew much more than we are prepared to admit. </span> <br> <br> <strong> <span __num="90" __label="true"> Amplifying your Aura vibration and bio-energy </span> </strong> <br> <br> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Things which can greatly amplify your aura are: </span> </p>
