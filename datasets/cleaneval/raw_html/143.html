           <br> 
           <br> 
           <span __num="9" __label="true"> The overall program is called the Electronic Universe because we useandpresent a lot of electronics and digital technology.&nbsp; We featurethreemajor digital items: Professor Bothun's new JAVA (interactiveweb-based)virtual physics labs/demos, projects using a CCD (digital camera), andOregonResearch Institute's new Sun-Earth-Moon virtual reality software. </span>

           <span __num="11" __label="true"> For the technology/measuring the sky program, there is extensivehardwaresetup, about 30 minutes, and also similar take-down time, and severalboxesof gear to transport, so placing me in one location and rotatingclassesin works best.&nbsp; Since we do a lot of "hands-on" activities,classesshould be under 30 students.&nbsp; We have found that "assemblies"don'twork for our main inquiry-based type of program.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'dlikea show-and-tell or pictureshow type of general program for an assembly,thatcan be arranged, but our program is primarily an inquiry-basedintroductionto the science of astrophysics, with a lot of participatory activities. </span>

           <span __num="13" __label="true"> Costwise, this year (2005)we are requesting between $10 and $100 perschool, regardless of numberof classes done, on a sliding scale, generally proportionate to thenumber of classes done but with consideration of available schoolbudget. (Example: 1 small class would be $10, a small “assembly” ormorning’s worth of individual classes might be $30, a multi-daypresentation to six classes would approach $100.)&nbsp; This amountgoes to Friends of Pine Mountain Observatory, not to the instructor,and&nbsp; is used to offset our overhead costs, primarily theproduction/distribution of the prep video, curriculum materials, andhardware usage.&nbsp; NASA's Oregon Space Grant currently coversinstructor cost and travel costs for trips throughout westernOregon.&nbsp; For extended distant trips, we may request someadditional funding to help cover the travel expenses.&nbsp; Visitingmultiple destinations during one trip will help share costs. </span>

           <br> 
           <span __num="49" __label="true"> Next we cover, using models, the vocabulary of Moon, Planet, Star/Sun,SolarSystem, Nebula, Galaxy, and Universe.&nbsp; Then we create a scalemodelof the Solar System and beyond on a real football field, an activityyoucan duplicate. </span> 
           <br> 
           <span __num="50" __label="true"> Finally we explore the basic concepts of light, introducing viewers totheterm "photons", and noting that to "see" anything we need a source ofphotonsand a detector of photons (stars and our eyes).&nbsp; We tie the wholeprogramtogether with a final demonstration with a flashlight to show howphotonsfrom a distant source spread out, thus why objects in deep space are sodim,so hard to explore. </span> 
           <br> 
           <span __num="51" __label="true"> The actual classroom outreach program then gives the students theopportunitiesto explore the collection/detection/measuring technologies (telescopesandCCD cameras) and includes computer labs where actual research can bedone. </span>

           <br> 
           <span __num="54" __label="true"> Our major concern is that students have the overview of vast distances,hierarchy/vocabularyof types of objects, and initial exposure to concept of photons for thetechnologyprogram, as we don't have time within the class to cover thesetopics.&nbsp;For example, the students should understand the difference between aSolarSystem and a Galaxy, functionally, in appearance, and in scale. </span>
