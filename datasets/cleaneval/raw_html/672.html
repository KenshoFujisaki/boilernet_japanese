   <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> What does it mean for something to be object oriented? Whatexactly is an ``Object Oriented Programming Language?'' Theseare questions that no one can answer very well. As Tim Rentsch said: </span> </p> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p> <span __num="24" __label="true"> `` </span> <em> <span __num="25" __label="true"> ...object oriented programming will be in the 1980's what structured programming was in the 1970's. Everyone will be in favor of it. Every manufacturer will promote his products as supporting it. Every manager will pay lip service to it. Every programmer will practice it (differently). And no one will know just what it is. </span> </em> <span __num="26" __label="true"> '' [Rentsch82] </span> </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Generally speaking, Rentsch was right not only about the 1980's, butthe 1990's as well. With all the various ``Object Oriented ProgrammingLanguages'' and ``Object Oriented Processes'' and ``Object OrientedBasket Weaving'' in the world today, it seems that establishing aclear definition of what it means to be object oriented, isimpossible. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> It would appear that instead of attempting to find a coherentdefinition, a better approach is to accept the idea that programminglanguages, or processes (or widgets) can not ``Be Object Oriented.''Instead, we should consider object orientedness as a ``notion'' which canbe associated with systems, programs, languages, etc... Or similarly,as a property that something can exhibit. But just because one facetof a system has object oriented properties, does not mean that thesystem as a whole (or even other potions of the system) is objectoriented. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> When dealing specifically with programming, and programming languages,it is important to keep in mind 3 principles: </span> </p> 
   <ul> 
    <p> </p> 
    <li> <span __num="30" __label="true"> A design can be Object Oriented, even if the resulting program isn't.[Madsen88] </span> </li> 
    <li> <span __num="31" __label="true"> A program can be Object Oriented, even if the language it'swritten in isn't.[Madsen88] </span> </li> 
    <li> <span __num="32" __label="true"> An Object Oriented program can be written in almost anylanguage, but a language can't be associated with object orientednessunless it </span> <em> <span __num="33" __label="true"> promotes </span> </em> <span __num="34"> Object Oriented Programs.[Stroustrup91] </span> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="35" __label="true"> But all of this side steps the issue that people ultimately want tounderstand: ``What makes programming languages objectoriented?'' To address this question, consider some excerpts (froman assortment of papers) that attempt to clarify the issue: </span> </p> 
   <p> </p> 
   <blockquote>

   <p> <span __num="121" __label="true"> In 1961 Nygaard was working for the Norwegian Computing Center (NCC),doing work with simulations and system analysis. Nygraad felt thatinstead of using existing tools, the best way to approach simulationprogramming, would be to have a special purpose simulation programming language,that could be used to model systems easily. With his background insimulations, he teamed up with Dahl (an experienced programmer withexperience in language design) in 1962. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="122" __label="true"> Nygaard and Dahl proposed their idea for a simulation language in1963, and although their ideas did not receive much enthusiasm,political issues at the NCC resulted in a contract between the NCC andUNIVAC to provide a Simula implementation and compiler by 1965 - NCCdid so, and the result is known as ``Simula-I''. Refinements were madeto Simula I and in 1967 ``Simula-67'' was released. The most recentstandard is Simula-87. </span> </p> 
   <p> </p> 
   <h4> <a name="tth_sEc3.1.4"> </a> <span __num="123" __label="true"> 3.1.4&nbsp;Features and Design </span> </h4> 
   <p> <span __num="124" __label="true"> Simula started out as an activity/process based programming language, inwhich different types (and behavior) of activities are declared, andthen multiple processes can be created to carry out differentactivities. The key power in this original design, was that inaddition to having lists of actions to be performed, processes werealso data structures, and activities has associated methods. Theseactivities and processes had so much use besides just that ofsimulation, that when Simula-67 was released, they had been renamed``classes'' and ``objects'' (thus the birth of ``object oriented''programming). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="125" __label="true"> In addition to all the features of Algol 60, Simula added support forObjects (as closures which return references to themselves) withprotected state, single inheritance for sub-typing and code sharing,partially abstract classes, method overriding, and nested closures(including nested procedures, classes, and classes local to procedures). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="126" __label="true"> Its interesting to note that as the father of object orientedlanguages, Simula-67 does not support dynamic dispatch - something mostpeople consider necessary for ``true'' object oriented programming.Instead, an object must be downcast (error checked at run time) andthe appropriate attribute/method can then be accessed. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="134" __label="true"> In 1961, Alan Kay was a programmer for the Air force, and noticed thatsomeone had designed a system for ``Burroughs 220'' magnetic tapes inwhich the data on the tape could be of arbitrary format and size, thebeginning of the tape contained the actual code necessary to extractthe particular type of date (This would eventually come to be known asencapsulating code and date into objects). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> In 1966, Kay went to graduate school at the University of Utah, on hisfirst day he was handed a packet of orientation information - whichincluded a paper on ``Sketchpad'' by Ivan Sutherland - and found on hisdesk a pile of tapes and printouts with the note ``This is the Algolfor the 1108. It doesn't work, Please make it work.'' </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> Starting with the packet of information, Kay was fascinated bySutherland's paper. Sketchpad was a revolutionary graphics workstation(for it's time) which among other things: enabled the user to create``master drawings'' and from a master, create multitudes of ``instancedrawings'' with their own distinct characteristics. In addition, the datastructures used by Sketchpad were similar to the B220 tapes he hadseen in the Air Force, with embedded pointers for modifying thestructure. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="137" __label="true"> Kay eventually got to work on the ``Algo'' printouts on his desk, andwas thoroughly confused, there were many constructs he had neverseen before and ``the documentation read like Norwegian translatedinto English.''[Kay93] What Kay had inadvertently been given was a copy ofSimula-I. Looking over the printouts, and reading the documentation,he realized the immense potential of programming withconstructs like Simula's activities and processes, or Sketchpad'smasters and instances. Kay quickly developed a vague idea forprogramming by not only breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems, but by breaking the computer down into thousands of smallersimulated computers (or objects) to solve all of the sub problems. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="138" __label="true"> Kay began working on ``personal computers'' with an eye towards an``object oriented'' interface. In 1970 left Utah to work for XeroxPARC, and began developing a desktop computer or use by childrencalled ``KiddiKomp'' (later ``miniCOM'') which had a combinationprogramming language / user interface called Smalltalk(-71) to stressit's ease of use. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="139" __label="true"> Smalltalk was redefined from scratch in 1972 on a bet, (that Kay coulddefine the ``most powerful language in the world'' in ``a page of code'')and Smalltalk-72 has since been considered the first "real Smalltalk".Smalltalk was redesigned again in 1976 by Dan Ingalls, and then againin 1980 just before it was released to the public. </span> </p> 
   <p> </p> 
   <h4> <a name="tth_sEc3.2.4"> </a> <span __num="140" __label="true"> 3.2.4&nbsp;Features and Design </span> </h4> 
   <p> <span __num="141" __label="true"> Smalltalk is an untyped, class based language. To better model thedifference between performing actions on types of objects, and on adistinct object, Smalltalk classifies attributes and methods asbelonging to either the class or to instances. Class methods arelocated in the class meta-object and can only refer to classattributes (also located in the meta-object to provide shared state forall instances). Instance methods are kept locally to each object andcan refer to both the class variables and the instance variables(which provide local state) All methods are public, while allattributes are private. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="142" __label="true"> Single inheritance is provided, along with (partially) abstractclasses, and method overriding (including signature modification).Although Smalltalk is untyped, the main purpose of inheritance is notjust code sharing. The underlying principle is similar to sub-typingin that programmers should use inheritance to provide specializationof objects, and can subsequently feel secure that it will be safe touse an instance of a subclass as if it were an instance of thesuperclass - without having to worry about run time errors. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="185" __label="true"> Classes may contain (multiple) Feature clauses which can in turncontain multiple Attributes/values and Routines/procedures. Theclassification of a given feature (Routine or Attribute) is unknown toother classes, ie: an Attribute of type T has the same ``appearance'' asa Routine which takes no arguments and returns an item of type T.Each Feature list has an associated Client list specifying the Classes(of objects) which are permitted to access those particular features.Classes may also Defer the implementation of any feature, making it(and any sub-class which does not provide an implementation for eachdeferred feature) an Abstract class. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="186" __label="true"> Genericity classes are class templates declared with Formal GenericParameters which may be constrained by a super-class. Instantiating aGeneric class requires an Actual Generic Parameter (which is asub-class of the specified constraint) for each formal parameter.These Generic classes provide source code reuse, but not target codereuse. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="187" __label="true"> Eiffel supports multiple inheritance (including code reuse) withcompiler enforced Renaming of conflicting features. In addition,Eiffel allows the programmer to not only Redefine (or Undefine) theimplementation of particular features, but also modify the Client listof inherited features. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="188" __label="true"> An interesting ``feature'' of the Eiffel specification, is that featureRedefinition is covariant. The reasoning is that for most situations,covariance is more useful then contravariance, and even though thelanguage specification allows the possibility of the run-time typeerrors, it is the responsibility of the compiler to catch thesesituations. But, as the Eiffel FAQ admits: </span> </p> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p> <span __num="189" __label="true"> `` </span> <em> <span __num="190" __label="true"> no compiler available today implements full static type checking. Some insert run-time checks. </span> </em> <span __num="191" __label="true"> '' [Arnaud98] </span> </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p> <span __num="192" __label="true"> One of the most predominant features of Eiffel is built in support for``Design By Contract'', which is not necessarily object oriented, butworks well with object oriented design processes. Eiffel providesAssertions in the form of Invariants over objects, andPre/Postconditions on individual routines. In general, an Assertionis a boolean expression which has no effect if true, but otherwiseresults in a Run Time Exception. Preconditions are evaluated prior tothe body of the associated routine (in the scope of the routine'sbody, with the formal parameters bound to the actual arguments).Postconditions are evaluated after the body of the associated routine(again, in the scope of the routine's body, with the formal parametersbound to the actual arguments). Invariants are evaluated after anyfeature is accessed. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="193" __label="true"> Assertions are extremely powerful when combined with Inheritance.Eiffel requires not only that the Invariants of all super-classes arecompatible, but that the Redefinition of any feature must eitherad-hear to the initial Pre/Postconditions of the superclass, or have a weakerPrecondition and a stronger Postcondition. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="206" __label="true"> The biggest difference between Sather and Eiffel is the Inheritancesystem. In Sather, Inheritance is divided into 2 notions: Sub-typing,and Code Inclusion. </span> </p>

A(Concrete) Class my be declared as a Sub-type of an Abstract class, andall objects of the Class then automatically conform to the type of theAbstract class.

   <p> <span __num="208" __label="true"> In contrast to Sub-typing, Code Inclusion allows a class to directlyimport the implementation of other (multiple) classes, for the purposeof code reuse (without any affect on the Includer's type). The IncludingClass may Redefine, Undefine, Rename, or modify the access permissionsof any included Routines or Attribute, with compiler enforced Renamingof name conflicts. Similar to the notion of Abstract Classes withSub-Typing, there are Partial Classes, which posses no type (andhence: can not be instantiated) but may be included by any number ofConcrete Classes </span> </p>
