      <img alt="" class="right" height="215" src="/fresh-intelligence/cbshookernemesis-inside.jpg" width="224"> 
      <p> <span __num="16" __label="true"> CBS was clearly looking for a fresh start when it replaced theMemogate-tainted </span> <strong> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Andrew Heyward </span> </strong> <span __num="18" __label="true"> with </span> <strong> <span __num="19" __label="true"> SeanMcManus </span> </strong> <span __num="20" __label="true"> as president of its news division. But unfortunately theappointment seems to have brought McManus a tawdry blast from his own past. Wehear a mentally unstable former bra model who once had a one-night encounterwith McManus—and whom the exec had arrested after she threatened to tellthe press—recently went on a rampage after hearing about hispromotion. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> The sordid affair began when McManus, at the time V.P. for CBS Sports, wentto an Upper East Side bar on the night of the 1997 U.S. Open and met </span> <strong> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Charlotte von Vogt </span> </strong> <span __num="23" __label="true"> , a then 46-year-old part-time prostitute andformer bra model once known for having “the most beautiful breasts in theworld”—at least according to famed flack </span> <strong> <span __num="24" __label="true"> Dick Falk </span> </strong> <span __num="25" __label="true"> .The exec reportedly enjoyed a few rounds of cocktails with the buxom blonde, then invited her back to his Park Avenue apartment for a nightcap. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> It was at this point that their memories of the evening diverge. Von Vogt hasclaimed that she and McManus embarked on a night of drinking, drug use, andkinky sex. In court, an attorney for McManus categorized the whole encountersimply as “a chat, a walk, a drink, [and] a simple and chastegoodbye.” The one thing that’s certain is that after the two parted,von Vogt began to call McManus nonstop, demanding that he acknowledge what sheclaims transpired between them and pleading with him to attend a session withher psychiatrist. When she finally threatened him in February1998­­—after 15 fruitless calls, many of which McManus secretlyrecorded—that she would go public with her story if he persisted indenying what ocurred, he had her arrested for harassment and“telephone stalking.” (McManus, incidentally, had just gottenmarried the previous June.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> When the case went to court in 1999, McManus was cross-examined twice aboutthe evening in front of a press-filled gallery. (So much for keeping it out ofthe papers.) Von Vogt, however, suffered a nervous breakdown during theproceedings—brought on, she claimed, by the investigatorsCBS had sicced on her—and the judge declared her unfit for trial.Afterwards, her attorney, </span> <strong> <span __num="28" __label="true"> David Breitbart </span> </strong> <span __num="29" __label="true"> , suggested shesee a new therapist to deal with the emotional fallout from the case. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="30" __label="true"> According to a source close to the trial, von Vogt only saw the therapistbriefly before dropping out of sight—until October of this year, whenMcManus was announced as the incoming CBS News head. We’re told she began calling the female shrink nonstop, venting her anger over the exec’s promotion and claiming “she was going to use [the psychiatrist] to get toMcManus.” Then, last Halloween, von Vogt followed the shrink fromher office and attempted to push her into oncoming traffic on York Avenue and75th Street in Manhattan, screaming, “You Bitch! You piece of garbage! You’rejust a pawn to get to McManus!” She was arrested and, last we heard, was beingheld without bail. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> McManus could not be reached by presstime. </span> </p>

      <p> <strong> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Anna Wintour </span> </strong> <span __num="38" __label="true"> can’t catch a break. Just two days after PETA plastered bathrooms at the </span> <em> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Vogue </span> </em> <span __num="40" __label="true"> editor’s favorite haunts with stickers calling her a “fur hag,” we hear the animal rights faction is planning an all-out assault on her staff—with Christmas cards. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="41" __label="true"> According to PETA spokesman </span> <strong> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Michael McGraw </span> </strong> <span __num="43" __label="true"> , the anti-fur outfit is planning to mail festive green-and-red envelopes to the glossy’s staff containing illustrated peek-a-boo cards that open to reveal an emaciated Wintour in her underwear. A message scrawled on the front and inside reads: “Without Fur I Am Nothing.” (Fashionistas may recall similar cards being handed out during New York Fashion Week in 2000.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> “We have a mailing list for the entire staff of </span> <em> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Vogue </span> </em> <span __num="46" __label="true"> , and they’ll be going out this week to everyone,” McGraw said. Asked how PETA had obtained the list, the rep first cracked, “That’s proprietary information,” before saying, somewhat ominously, “Not everyone on Anna’s staff shares her fetish for fur.” (Of course, they could have just looked at the masthead.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Why is PETA so stuck on Wintour? </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> “We’ve been trying to work with the magazine since the early nineties, but they have repeatedly turned down paid PETA anti-fur ads sight-unseen,” the spokesman said, adding that advertisements featuring “some of the biggest names in Hollywood” like </span> <strong> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Charlize Theron </span> </strong> <span __num="50" __label="true"> , </span> <strong> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Kim Basinger </span> </strong> <span __num="52" __label="true"> , and </span> <strong> <span __num="53" __label="true"> Pamela Anderson </span> </strong> <span __num="54" __label="true"> have run in other fashion mags. “We simply ask for equal time. If they’re going to promote fur through dozens and dozens of editorial and advertising pages each month, at least let us pay for an anti-fur ad.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> While Wintour shows no signs of bending to her blood-tossing bêtes noires, McGraw says the group “remains hopeful that Anna will have a change of heart.” After all, </span> <strong> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Martha Stewart </span> </strong> <span __num="57" __label="true"> , who was at the top of PETA’s “worst-dressed list” last year, has since “learned about the cruelty involved and actually narrated an </span> <a href="http://www.furisdead.com/feat-martha.asp" target="_blank"> <span __num="58" __label="true"> anti-fur video </span> </a> <span __num="59" __label="true"> for us,” he said. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> If Wintour fails to follow Martha’s lead, what kind of greeting can she expect for the next Hallmark holiday? “We have no plans yet for Easter,” McGraw said, “though Valentine’s Day may see some PETA cupids outside Condé Nast.” </span> </p>

According to a source who has seen the footage—which features a self-described downtown coke dealer relating his late-night run-in with the First Daughter, and brandishing her college ID as a souvenir—the man insinuates that the two shared more than just drinks. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> A well-informed source, who has a DVD copy of the interview shot by </span> <a href="http://www.tbirdshow.com" target="_blank"> <span __num="70" __label="true"> tbirdshow.com </span> </a> <span __num="71"> ’s </span> <b> <span __num="72" __label="true"> Travis Poston </span> </b> <span __num="73" __label="true"> , says that at one point the dealer claims that the young, blonde Jenna Bush with the Texas accent he hung out with that night (and who happened to leave behind Jenna Bush’s belongings) had been “helping [him] clean up” the bar after a long night of partying. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="74" __label="true"> (A publicist for First Lady </span> <b> <span __num="75" __label="true"> Laura Bush </span> </b> <span __num="76" __label="true"> has unequivocally denied that her daughter has ever been to the Chinatown bar, Happy Ending, even though we hear the UT-Austin ID card displayed in the film clearly shows the hard-partying political liability’s name, picture and student ID number.) </span> </p>

Get in line.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="82" __label="true"> Needless to say, “if a coke dealer has your ID it doesn’t look so good,” quipped the source. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Apparently, the affable salesman doesn’t limit his company to presidential offspring. “He brags on camera that he’s down with all the members of Interpol,” our source says. “And everybody in the club that walks by in the video says ‘hi’ to him.” </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="94" __label="true"> According to a source involved in the talks, a hand-picked group of employees was summoned to a video conference last Wednesday to learn what would be expected of them if the show gets greenlit. The producer will begin interviewing candidates this week in search of eight staffers worthy of being tailed by round-the-clock camera crews, we hear. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="95"> “ </span> <em> <span __num="96" __label="true"> Star </span> </em> <span __num="97" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="98" __label="true"> Celebrity Living </span> </em> <span __num="99" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="100" __label="true"> Men’s Fitness </span> </em> <span __num="101" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="102" __label="true"> Shape </span> </em> <span __num="103" __label="true"> —we had people from everywhere,” the source said when asked about the cattle call. “We’re having meetings, but there’s no pen to paper yet. We haven’t made a commitment but we’re exploring it.” The only thing certain, the source added, is that the proposed series won’t prominently feature Pecker or editorial director </span> <strong> <span __num="104" __label="true"> Bonnie Fuller </span> </strong> <span __num="105" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="106" __label="true"> Tentatively called </span> <em> <span __num="107" __label="true"> One Park Avenue </span> </em> <span __num="108" __label="true"> after the company’s Manhattan address (“We don’t own the rights to that title yet,” the source noted, saying the producer would have to license them from the building), the show will be “about the lives of the people who work here versus just about the magazines.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="109" __label="true"> According to multiple AMI sources, those willing to sacrifice their remaining shreds of dignity to the company’s multimedia ambitions will indeed be paid. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="110" __label="true"> “We get pitches all the time from people, and this is just one of many,” the source said. “I’m sure if you call any magazine company, everyone is looking to get their name on TV. I mean, </span> <em> <span __num="111" __label="true"> Glamor </span> </em> <span __num="112" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="113" __label="true"> Vogue </span> </em> <span __num="114" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="115" __label="true"> Us Weekly </span> </em> <span __num="116" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="117" __label="true"> Rolling Stone </span> </em> <span __num="118" __label="true"> , </span> <em> <span __num="119" __label="true"> Seventeen </span> </em> <span __num="120" __label="true"> —they’re all looking for opportunities to get on TV.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="121" __label="true"> The source declined to name the producer who pitched the series, saying only that he was “pretty well-established” in the genre. According to AMI insiders, the mystery producer has worked on both </span> <em> <span __num="122" __label="true"> Extreme Makeover: Home Edition </span> </em> <span __num="123" __label="true"> and Showtime’s </span> <em> <span __num="124" __label="true"> Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! </span> </em> <span __num="125" __label="true"> The only producer fitting that description, according to IMDB, is reality TV vet </span> <strong> <span __num="126" __label="true"> Star Price </span> </strong> <span __num="127" __label="true"> whose spine-tingling credits like </span> <em> <span __num="128" __label="true"> The Scariest Places on Earth </span> </em> <span __num="129" __label="true"> and the upcoming </span> <em> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Nightmare on Elm Street: Real Nightmares </span> </em> <span __num="131" __label="true"> would seem to make him a perfect fit for capturing life in Bonnie-ville. (Price did not return calls for comment.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="132" __label="true"> Of course, some might ask whether it’s a good time to expose the privately held company’s inner workings to the public.

      <p> <span __num="139" __label="true"> This isn’t the first time Fuller and Co. have tried to bring life at a celeb weekly to the small screen. In 2003, when she was still at </span> <em> <span __num="140" __label="true"> Us Weekly </span> </em> <span __num="141" __label="true"> , a series reportedly nicknamed “The Bonnie Show” fell through because “it imposed on the real job of putting out a magazine every week—it encumbered the process.” The source claimed that </span> <em> <span __num="142" __label="true"> One Park Avenue </span> </em> <span __num="143" __label="true"> would be “totally different.” </span> </p>

      <img class="right" height="511" src="/fresh-intelligence/fordmcadams-inside.jpg" width="182"> 
      <p> <span __num="153" __label="true"> We hear flesh-obsessed designer </span> <b> <span __num="154" __label="true"> Tom Ford </span> </b> <span __num="155" __label="true"> ’s gig as guest editor of </span> <i> <span __num="156" __label="true"> Vanity Fair </span> </i> <span __num="157" __label="true"> ’s Hollywood Issue recently hit a kink. Sources close to the glossy say demure rising starlet </span> <strong> <span __num="158" __label="true"> Rachel McAdams </span> </strong> <span __num="159" __label="true"> stormed out of a November cover shoot for the annual industry mash note—and fired her publicist—after learning Ford expected her to pose nude. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> According to mag insiders, Ford had prearranged with McAdam’s rep, Wolf Kasteller’s </span> <strong> <span __num="161" __label="true"> Ame Van Iden </span> </strong> <span __num="162" __label="true"> , for the in-demand </span> <i> <span __num="163" __label="true"> Red Eye </span> </i> <span __num="164" __label="true"> actress to appear naked in a group portrait of Hollywood’s breathtaking beauties-of-the-moment, alongside </span> <strong> <span __num="165" __label="true"> Keira Knightley </span> </strong> <span __num="166" __label="true"> , </span> <strong> <span __num="167" __label="true"> Scarlett Johansson </span> </strong> <span __num="168" __label="true"> , and others. (We presume the shoot was conceived along the tasteful lines of Herb Ritts’ iconic 1989 supermodel ensemble, </span> <a href="http://www.postershop.co.uk/Ritts-Herb/Ritts-Herb-Stephanie-Cindy-Christy-Tatjana-Naomi-1989-8401144.html"> <span __num="169" __label="true"> “Stephanie Cindy Christy Tatjana Naomi” </span> </a> <span __num="170" __label="true"> , but considering Ford’s involvement it’s possible to imagine a raunchier scenario.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="171" __label="true"> Unfortunately for legions of mouth-breathing McAdams fans, we’re told Van Iden neglected to brief her family-friendly charge—who may have been the only actress in </span> <em> <span __num="172" __label="true"> Wedding Crashers </span> </em> <span __num="173" __label="true"> to keep all her clothes on—about the concept beforehand. When she arrived on the L.A. set and found out what Ford had in mind, we’re told she turned tail and promptly fired Van Iden. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="174" __label="true"> “Every magazine wants her on their cover and thinks she’s gonna be huge, so she can get away with being picky,” says a Condé Nast insider. “But everyone’s really impressed that she stood up for herself. It’s kind of amazing, actually.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="175" __label="true"> While the 29-year-old actress’s chaste retreat suggests she has a tad more dignity than the average Hollywood climber, it’s odd she was so blindsided by Ford’s request. After all, the former Gucci designer has previously told reporters the “entire issue would be naked,” and his recent work has certainly showcased his fondness for letting it all hang out—he posed </span> <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/tom-ford/tom-ford-confuses-your-fantasies-130249.php"> <i> <span __num="176" __label="true"> au naturel </span> </i> </a> <span __num="177" __label="true"> for a 22-page spread in last month’s </span> <i> <span __num="178" __label="true"> W </span> </i> <span __num="179" __label="true"> , his new line of cosmetics for Estee Lauder is called Amber Nude, his ad campaign for the fragrance Youth Dew features a naked </span> <strong> <span __num="180" __label="true"> Carolyn Murphy </span> </strong> <span __num="181" __label="true"> , and an advertisement he produced for a new line of sunglasses reportedly features porn stars whom he says were paid “to have sex on set.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="182" __label="true"> Neither Ford nor </span> <em> <span __num="183" __label="true"> VF </span> </em> <span __num="184" __label="true"> spokeswoman </span> <strong> <span __num="185" __label="true"> Beth Kseniak </span> </strong> <span __num="186" __label="true"> returned calls about the incident. McAdam’s manager, </span> <b> <span __num="187" __label="true"> Shelley Browning </span> </b> <span __num="188" __label="true"> , confirmed that McAdams “presently does not have a publicist,” but referred questions about the cover shoot to the magazine. Van Iden herself did not return calls. </span> </p> 
      <p> <strong> <span __num="189" __label="true"> UPDATE: </span> </strong> <span __num="190" __label="true"> So much for dignity. Even though McAdams fired her publicist for neglecting to tell her she was expected to pose nude, we hearshe ultimately decided a </span> <em> <span __num="191" __label="true"> VF </span> </em> <span __num="192" __label="true"> cover was toogood to pass up and returned to disrobe anyway.

No one talkedtoher beforehand about her client posing nude. (Seriously—if they had,shewould never have agreed to it).

      <img class="right" height="259" src="/fresh-intelligence/braunstein-inside.jpg" width="182"> 
      <p> <span __num="287" __label="true"> While New York’s finest chase reporter-turned-“Fire Fiend” </span> <strong> <span __num="288" __label="true"> Peter Braunstein </span> </strong> <span __num="289" __label="true"> from strip club to strip club across the Midwest, we hear the depraved journo’s victim has been trying to wrest herself free from the latest crime story to grip the local tabs. Sources say a number of the city’s news outlets have recently received legal letters from </span> <strong> <span __num="290" __label="true"> Lynda Goldman </span> </strong> <span __num="291" __label="true"> , a high-powered attorney—and partner at pitbull entertainment lawyer </span> <strong> <span __num="292" __label="true"> Marty Singer </span> </strong> <span __num="293" __label="true"> ’s firm, no less—whom the former </span> <em> <span __num="294" __label="true"> W </span> </em> <span __num="295" __label="true"> mag staffer has hired to keep her personal details out of the press. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="296" __label="true"> Though Goldman would not specify which publications have been contacted, she confirmed that she was retained “to encourage the media to behave in a responsible manner so that this victim isn’t victimized further.” The former </span> <em> <span __num="297" __label="true"> W </span> </em> <span __num="298" __label="true"> staffer—whose identity, while known in media circles, has been kept out of print—has been keeping a low profile since the Halloween attack, when Braunstein, a onetime co-worker at the fashion glossy, reportedly gained access to her Chelsea apartment by masquerading as a fireman, knocked her out with chloroform, and tied her to a chair before sexually molesting her for 12 hours. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="299" __label="true"> “I’ve been dealing with some issues because we’re very concerned about her privacy while this guy is still at large,” said Goldman. “It’s obviously very disturbing that he’s still out there and that he’s evaded the authorities for all this time, so any kind of identifying information that could lead him or other people to locate her is a major invasion of privacy that could put her life in jeopardy.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="300" __label="true"> Among the published details she finds particularly worrisome are where the victim works, where she lives, and even the name of her next-door neighbor, the attorney said. “And that’s not an inclusive list,” she added. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="301" __label="true"> While some have speculated that the victim hired a lawyer to keep her own identity under wraps until she is prepared to go public in some remunerative fashion, Goldman insists that’s not the case. “I wasn’t retained because she’s working on a book or movie or any nonsense like that,” she said. “I was retained because she was concerned, as anyone would be in her circumstance, about her privacy and her safety.” She added, however, that her client might be interested in telling her side of the story “somewhere down the road when this guy is incarcerated.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="302" __label="true"> Goldman—who explained she was chosen to represent her client because the two women “share a mutual friend”—said although she herself relies on newspaper reports for developments in the case, she is frustrated by how much info the media-savvy Braunstein might be gleaning from the coverage. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="303" __label="true"> “Some of the reporting I’ve seen just seems to me incredibly irresponsible,” she said. “If I’m reading a report in the press of somebody saying, ‘We just saw him at x location going to all these strip clubs,’ don’t you think that he reads the papers and says, ‘Oh, guess I better not go to any more strip clubs?’” Asked whether she had considered the possibility that police had planted those stories to flush Braunstein out, Goldman admitted, “I don’t know what law enforcement does during these situations, but as a citizen reading this stuff, it just strikes me as foolish.” </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="307" __label="true"> Publishing seductress </span> <strong> <span __num="308" __label="true"> Judith Regan </span> </strong> <span __num="309" __label="true"> has gotten away with her vindictive tantrums in the past, but sources say she may have chosen the wrong foe in her former PR director, </span> <strong> <span __num="310" __label="true"> Paul Crichton </span> </strong> <span __num="311" __label="true"> . Friends of the well-liked publicist say he hired an attorney to look into a possible libel suit after Regan dispatched a minion to smear him in the </span> <em> <span __num="312" __label="true"> New York Post </span> </em> <span __num="313" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="314" __label="true"> “Paul’s lawyer and his friends are all urging him to sue Regan and [Regan Books parent company] HarperCollins for defamation of character, slander, libel, whatever, for what they said about him in the </span> <em> <span __num="315" __label="true"> Post </span> </em> <span __num="316" __label="true"> ,” says a source close to Crichton, referring to last Wednesday’s Page Six item in which </span> <strong> <span __num="317" __label="true"> Paula Conway </span> </strong> <span __num="318" __label="true"> —identified as “Regan Media’s interim PR director”—accused the publicist of clearing his desk “at like midnight” and sneaking away after being questioned about “unauthorized spending in his department.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="319" __label="true"> “It was all a lie—he was never under investigation for anything,” says the source. (HarperCollins reps declined to comment on a departing employee, but a company source confirmed to the </span> <em> <span __num="320" __label="true"> New York Daily News </span> </em> <span __num="321" __label="true"> ’s Lowdown column that there was never an investigation.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="322" __label="true"> Furthermore, a top-level Regan Books employee said she didn’t know anything about Conway or an “interim PR director.” According to our source, that’s because “Paula is really just a freelance publicist who happens to be a close personal friend of </span> <strong> <span __num="323" __label="true"> Maureen Regan </span> </strong> <span __num="324" __label="true"> , Judith’s sister.” The two women are also co-authors of a book called </span> <em> <span __num="325" __label="true"> The Beauty Buyble: The Top 100 Beauty Products of 2006 </span> </em> <span __num="326" __label="true"> , scheduled to be published by Regan’s imprint next year. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="327" __label="true"> The real reason Crichton decided to leave—after shepherding 13 of Regan’s books onto the </span> <em> <span __num="328" __label="true"> New York Times </span> </em> <span __num="329" __label="true"> best-seller list—was that his boss was working him like a Siberian husky in the Iditarod, says our source. We’re told that the slight, 32-year-old publicist lost 10 pounds after taking on the responsibilities of associate publisher and director of marketing, in addition to his regular duties, when those positions were vacated in July. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="330" __label="true"> “Paul worked his ass off, but Judith was insisting that he sign a three-year contract at the same pay he was receiving before he took on the additional jobs and, on top of that, move to L.A.,” where Regan recently moved her operations, the source says. “When he called her to say he wouldn’t sign and to give notice, she hung up on him. Anyway, you can’t blame him for not looking forward to working with </span> <strong> <span __num="331" __label="true"> Victoria Gotti </span> </strong> <span __num="332" __label="true"> , </span> <strong> <span __num="333" __label="true"> Janice Dickinson </span> </strong> <span __num="334" __label="true"> , and </span> <strong> <span __num="335" __label="true"> Kimora Lee </span> </strong> <span __num="336" __label="true"> —all of whom have books coming out next year.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="337" __label="true"> But while rumors have been circulating that Crichton may want to vent some of his frustrations by writing a tell-all detailing his ex-boss’s mean streak and infamous private exploits (like her ill-fated affair with wannabe Homeland Security czar </span> <strong> <span __num="338" __label="true"> Bernard Kerik </span> </strong> <span __num="339" __label="true"> ; call it, </span> <em> <span __num="340" __label="true"> The Devil Wears Nada </span> </em> <span __num="341" __label="true"> ) the publicist’s pal laughs the notion off, saying, “he’s no </span> <strong> <span __num="342" __label="true"> Bridie Clark </span> </strong> <span __num="343" __label="true"> .” Another former Regan Books employee, Clark is already hard at work on a </span> <em> <span __num="344" __label="true"> roman à clef </span> </em> <span __num="345" __label="true"> about the company—in which staffers are thinly disguised to skirt her confidentiality agreement, entitled </span> <em> <span __num="346" __label="true"> Because She Can </span> </em> <span __num="347" __label="true"> . Besides, Crichton may not have much time for writing. We’re told he’s starting a new job next Monday. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="348" __label="true"> Crichton himself could not be reached for comment, and calls to a Regan Books publicist were not returned by press time. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="352" __label="true"> While no one was surprised to learn of </span> <strong> <span __num="353" __label="true"> Jessica Simpson </span> </strong> <span __num="354" __label="true"> and </span> <strong> <span __num="355" __label="true"> Nick Lachey </span> </strong> <span __num="356" __label="true"> ’s split last week, we hear music biz insiders are buzzing about the possible marital troubles of another, less-stage-managed Hollywood couple— </span> <strong> <span __num="357" __label="true"> Heather Locklear </span> </strong> <span __num="358" __label="true"> and Bon Jovi guitarist </span> <strong> <span __num="359" __label="true"> Richie Sambora </span> </strong> <span __num="360" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="361" __label="true"> Long admired for sustaining one of the arena-rock world’s most stable marriages—their eleventh anniversary is later this month—the couple recently fell out over Sambora’s desire to give their 8-year-old daughter, </span> <strong> <span __num="362" __label="true"> Ava Elizabeth </span> </strong> <span __num="363" __label="true"> , a sibling, according to a source close to the band. We’re told the 44-year-old Locklear, who frequently complains about movie execs’ disdain for aging actresses, thinks a second child would hurt her chances at landing the sexy roles she specializes in. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="364" __label="true"> “She doesn’t want another kid because she thinks she’s Hollywood royalty,” says our source. “But Richie is an only child and desperately wants another kid.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="365" __label="true"> Another strain on the couple is the fact that Sambora has just embarked on a seven-month, 20-country world tour with Bon Jovi to promote their new album </span> <i> <span __num="366" __label="true"> Have a Nice Day </span> </i> <span __num="367" __label="true"> —and we’re told the band is doing everything they can to convince him to “dump [Locklear] and move on.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="368" __label="true"> “The members of the band never liked her anyway, particularly Jon [Bon Jovi],” says the source. “The band’s a bunch of blue-collar stiffs from New Jersey who feel that they got lucky. They’re regular guys, and Heather is spoiled—she still thinks that’s she’s an ingénue.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="369" __label="true"> But Sambora isn’t the only one looking for a way out, we hear. According to our source, Locklear has been “stepping out” on her husband. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="370" __label="true"> One person the </span> <i> <span __num="371" __label="true"> Perfect Man </span> </i> <span __num="372" __label="true"> actress has been spotted with frequently in recent months is her ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer </span> <strong> <span __num="373" __label="true"> Tommy Lee </span> </strong> <span __num="374" __label="true"> . As the </span> <i> <span __num="375" __label="true"> New York Post </span> </i> <span __num="376" __label="true"> ’s Page Six reported, Locklear invited the tattoo-festooned sex-tape auteur back to her place with six female friends after celebrating her birthday at a Manhattan restaurant in October. Apparently she’s forgiven Lee for his affair with porn star </span> <strong> <span __num="377" __label="true"> Debi Diamond </span> </strong> <span __num="378" __label="true"> , the incident that ended their marriage of seven years in 1993. </span> </p>

      <img class="left" height="271" src="/fresh-intelligence/schwarzenegger4-inside.jpg" width="182"> 
      <p> <span __num="383" __label="true"> Californians may not be happy with the lack of transparency in the Governator’s office, but none of </span> <b> <span __num="384" __label="true"> Arnold Schwarzenegger </span> </b> <span __num="385" __label="true"> ’s political dodges quite compare to his slipperiness in dealing with </span> <b> <span __num="386" __label="true"> Anna Richardson </span> </b> <span __num="387" __label="true"> , a British TV personality who is suing him for libel. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="388" __label="true"> Richardson first became a thorn in Schwarzenegger’s beefy flank when she was quoted in various news stories—including a landmark </span> <i> <span __num="389" __label="true"> Premiere </span> </i> <span __num="390" __label="true"> magazine article headlined “Arnold the Barbarian”—saying that the actor had pulled her onto his lap and pinched her nipple after a December 2000 interview for her London-based show </span> <i> <span __num="391" __label="true"> Big Screen </span> </i> <span __num="392" __label="true"> . When Schwarzenegger’s team attacked her in an October 2003 </span> <i> <span __num="393" __label="true"> Los Angeles Times </span> </i> <span __num="394" __label="true"> story about the then-candidate’s wandering hands—claiming that she’d hopped on his lap, seductively cupped her breasts and asked, “What do you think of these?”—the 35-year-old vicar’s daughter filed a libel suit against the governor and two of his associates. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="395" __label="true"> Since then, we hear, the governor and his lawyer, </span> <b> <span __num="396" __label="true"> Marty Singer </span> </b> <span __num="397" __label="true"> , have tried every lowdown trick in the book to weasel out of the lawsuit—even going so far as to refuse to accept the service of legal papers for nearly a year, according to a source close to Richardson. (We’re told Singer only relented after her barrister, </span> <b> <span __num="398" __label="true"> Graham Atkins </span> </b> <span __num="399" __label="true"> , sent him at least three personal letters demanding that he take the case seriously.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="400" __label="true"> Schwarzenegger has also tried to distance himself from the suit, saying </span> <b> <span __num="401" __label="true"> Sheryl Main </span> </b> <span __num="402" __label="true"> (the Columbia Tristar flack quoted in the </span> <em> <span __num="403" __label="true"> L.A. Times </span> </em> <span __num="404" __label="true"> story, now a member of the governor’s communications team) and </span> <b> <span __num="405" __label="true"> Sean Walsh </span> </b> <span __num="406" __label="true"> (a former campaign spokesman, now director of the state Office of Planning and Research) were not acting with his knowledge or at his behest when they disseminated the slur. Our source says that, in papers filed in his defense, the governor has even denied any official connection to “Californians for Schwarzenegger,” the nonprofit reelection committee that is paying the trio’s legal fees. If that’s the case, the governor may want to refresh his memory. According to municipal documents, Schwarzenegger owns Main Street Plaza, the Santa Monica building that houses the committee’s headquarters. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="407" __label="true"> In another curious passage in his defense papers, we’re told that Schwarzenegger “denies that he has a history of sexual misconduct… and the Claimant must prove the grounds on which she alleges that any such history is now admitted or well-documented or was at the time of his election campaign a matter of public knowledge.” While the governor may somehow be under the impression that Brits can’t read American publications, which have obsessively covered Arnold’s multiple groping allegations, the governor’s own admission that “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” and that he’s “behaved badly” towards women have been trumpeted by a dozen UK papers as well. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="408" __label="true"> At least Richardson is having it easier than </span> <b> <span __num="409" __label="true"> Rhonda Miller </span> </b> <span __num="410" __label="true"> . After the former stuntwoman announced the day before Schwarzenegger’s election that he had grabbed her breasts, Walsh told reporters that Miller had a history of prostitution and drug abuse. Though the allegations were completely untrue, Miller’s suit was overturned in court thanks to America’s defendant-friendly libel laws. (Luckily for Richardson, Brit law puts the burden of proof on the defense in such cases.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="411" __label="true"> At the end of the day, Schwarzenegger’s maneuvers will probably come to naught. Ever since a judge declared the governor was “not peripheral” to the case, experts have predicted that a settlement is the only way for Schwarzenegger to avoid an inconvenient appearance before a judge in a powdered wig—probably during his 2006 reelection campaign. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="412" __label="true"> Reached for comment, Singer declined to discuss his defense strategy—”I’m not an English attorney, but I’ve been told that you’re not supposed to comment on papers filed”—but denied that he or Schwarzenegger had resisted being served. “We resisted </span> <em> <span __num="413" __label="true"> jurisdiction </span> </em> <span __num="414" __label="true"> ,” Singer said. “That’s why the papers weren’t accepted, per se.

      <p> <span __num="419" __label="true"> We hear </span> <strong> <span __num="420" __label="true"> Bob Woodward </span> </strong> <span __num="421" __label="true"> ’s not the only respected journalist to have his objectivity swayed by access to the high and mighty. Sources at </span> <em> <span __num="422" __label="true"> Us Weekly </span> </em> <span __num="423" __label="true"> say the mag’s West Coast editor, </span> <strong> <span __num="424" __label="true"> Ken Baker, </span> </strong> <span __num="425" __label="true"> has gotten a little too close to </span> <strong> <span __num="426" __label="true"> Paris Hilton </span> </strong> <span __num="427" __label="true"> , and that his not-so-secret obsession with his number-one source is affecting his coverage. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="428" __label="true"> According to insiders at the gossip glossy, the 35-year-old Baker spends a large part of his day on the phone with Paris, and insists on putting a positive spin on anything published about the heiress—much to the consternation of his boss, </span> <strong> <span __num="429" __label="true"> Janice Min </span> </strong> <span __num="430" __label="true"> . “I think this goes far beyond a crush,” confides a friend of Hilton’s. “Every time her phone rings, it’s Ken. He calls more than any other guy, even more than her boyfriends.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="431" __label="true"> The relationship has clearly benefited Baker, who is seen as something of a wunderkind in the business for his ability to bring in celebrity exclusives. Since Paris first appeared on the national scene in 2003 with her infrared sex tape, </span> <em> <span __num="432" __label="true"> Us Weekly </span> </em> <span __num="433" __label="true"> has broken the lion’s share of Hilton-related scoops—her break-up with </span> <strong> <span __num="434" __label="true"> Nick Carter </span> </strong> <span __num="435" __label="true"> , her harrowing account of her hacked Sidekick ordeal, and her engagement to </span> <strong> <span __num="436" __label="true"> Paris Latsis </span> </strong> <span __num="437" __label="true"> . (The couple’s breakup, </span> <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/09/23/index.php" target="_blank"> <span __num="438" __label="true"> we broke </span> </a> <span __num="439" __label="true"> . </span> <em> <span __num="440" __label="true"> US weekly </span> </em> <span __num="441" __label="true"> followed up a week later with the </span> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9548440/" target="_blank"> <span __num="442" __label="true"> “official” story </span> </a> <span __num="443" __label="true"> , straight from Hilton herself.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="444" __label="true"> What could the two possibly be talking about? According to a mag insider, “Paris uses Ken to plant negative items about her enemies, like </span> <strong> <span __num="445" __label="true"> Nicole Richie </span> </strong> <span __num="446" __label="true"> .” In fact, one of the memos found on Hilton’s pilfered Sidekick—“tell ken about jess trying to bone JT”—was widely deciphered as a reminder to tell Baker that </span> <strong> <span __num="447" __label="true"> Jessica Simpson </span> </strong> <span __num="448" __label="true"> was stalking the wild </span> <strong> <span __num="449" __label="true"> Timbersnake </span> </strong> <span __num="450" __label="true"> . (The phone’s address book, conveniently enough, contained Baker’s digits, too.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="451" __label="true"> Even in public, Baker has made little attempt to conceal his admiration for his prize canary: he once told Fox News’ </span> <strong> <span __num="452" __label="true"> Greta Van Susteran </span> </strong> <span __num="453" __label="true"> , “When it comes to Paris Hilton, you either love her, loathe her, or lust after her, but either way … you have to admit she’s fascinating,” and even based a character on her—the inventively named London Marriott—in his new satirical roman a clef, </span> <em> <span __num="454" __label="true"> Hollywood Hussein </span> </em> <span __num="455" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="456" __label="true"> Sadly, the feeling apparently isn’t mutual: “Paris thinks it’s funny when he calls, and will sometimes taunt and even abuse him,” says Hilton’s pal. “She brags that he’s obsessed with her and wants to fuck her.” That’s gratitude for you. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="457" __label="true"> Asked about his special friendship with the hotel heiress, Baker played down his role in bringing home the Hilton bacon and denied there was any “quid pro quo” involved. “Paris has chosen to give exclusive interviews to </span> <i> <span __num="458" __label="true"> Us </span> </i> <span __num="459" __label="true"> on several occasions because, I would imagine, she realizes our young readership is her fan base,” he said. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="460" __label="true"> “Also, </span> <i> <span __num="461" __label="true"> Us Weekly </span> </i> <span __num="462" __label="true"> has covered several major news events concerning Paris Hilton with aggressive journalism. For example, we were the only magazine to run a cover on her Sidekick scandal and, most recently, we broke news that Paris had ‘stolen’ </span> <b> <span __num="463" __label="true"> Mary Kate Olsen </span> </b> <span __num="464" __label="true"> ’s boyfriend. I’d imagine Paris would have prefered these stories weren’t given so much coverage, but as a news magazine that is our responsibility to our readers.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="465" __label="true"> Baker went on to say that the idea Paris toyed with him on the phone was a “fiction,” adding that he hadn’t interviewed her in over a month. “If you hear from her, tell her I said ‘Hi!’” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="466" __label="true"> We tried to, but Hilton’s crisis manager, </span> <b> <span __num="467" __label="true"> Elliot Mintz </span> </b> <span __num="468" __label="true"> , did not return calls or e-mails, and her publicist, PMK’s </span> <b> <span __num="469" __label="true"> Jack Ketsoyan </span> </b> <span __num="470" __label="true"> , was “traveling” and could not be reached. </span> </p>

According to a source who spotted the reality show </span> <em> <span __num="481" __label="true"> paterfamilias </span> </em> <span __num="482" __label="true"> at the Cartier flagship store in Manhattan Monday afternoon, Hilton left patronsand staff there appalled at his bad manners. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="483" __label="true"> “I was sitting next to him on the sofa, and he had this very arrogantposture, with his ankle over his knee and his arm slung over his chair while hetalked loudly on his cell phone,” says our source, who was waiting to pickup a watch. “I knew I knew him from somewhere, and then a young woman[from Cartier] approached him, saying, ‘Hilton! Hilton! Mr. Hilton!’He didn’t move, he didn’t acknowledge anybody, he just kept gabbingon his cell phone, saying, ‘I don’t know why I kept this watch, Iliked the other one I had.’ Yap, yap, yap.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="484" __label="true"> We’re told that when customers complained and asked the clerk if theycould be helped while the flush-faced 50-year-old hotel heir chatted away onhis phone, “She said, ‘Oh, I have to take care of Mr. Hilton,’and kind of rolled her eyes.” Visibly annoyed, the clerk called out,“Mr. Hilton!” and he closed his phone and “went up to takecare of whatever business he had to take care of.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="485" __label="true"> As soon as Hilton left, the clerk turned to our source and cracked, “Ohwell, I guess you can’t buy class.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="486" __label="true"> Called for comment, an employee at the Cartier store on Fifth Avenue and 52ndStreet said she did not recall the incident. Hilton could not be reached bypress time. </span> </p>

      <p> <span __num="496" __label="true"> Schaffel—who recently </span> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/MichaelJackson/story?id=1336379&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312" target="_blank"> <span __num="497" __label="true"> aired a phone message on </span> <em> <span __num="498" __label="true"> Good Morning America </span> </em> </a> <span __num="499" __label="true"> in which the singer declares, “I love you, Marc. I really need you to get $7 million for me as soon as possible”—is seeking $3 million in loans to Jackson that remain unpaid. But not long ago he was loyally working as the gloved one’s business partner and producer on both his disastrous 2001 album </span> <i> <span __num="500" __label="true"> Invincible </span> </i> <span __num="501" __label="true"> and a 9/11 tribute concert Jackson planned to hold in Washington D.C. Jacko watchers may also recall Schaffel’s star turn as an </span> <a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:ihi0kvVbYOsJ:www.dailybreeze.com/news/r%20egstate/articles/1328317.html+unindicted+co-conspirator+marc+schaffel&amp;hl=en&amp;%20client=safari" target="_blank"> <span __num="502" __label="true"> unindicted co-conspirator </span> </a> <span __num="503" __label="true"> in the singer’s most recent round of pedophilia allegations. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="504" __label="true"> It was for the 9/11 tribute project that Schaffel (who, under the </span> <i> <span __num="505" __label="true"> nom de porn </span> </i> <span __num="506" __label="true"> “Marc Fredericks,” has directed over 400 gay porn titles including </span> <em> <span __num="507" __label="true"> The Man With the Golden Rod </span> </em> <span __num="508" __label="true"> and </span> <em> <span __num="509" __label="true"> Cocktales </span> </em> <span __num="510" __label="true"> ), turned to </span> <strong> <span __num="511" __label="true"> David Kuo, </span> </strong> <span __num="512" __label="true"> then an adviser to </span> <strong> <span __num="513" __label="true"> President Bush </span> </strong> <span __num="514" __label="true"> and the deputy director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="515" __label="true"> Jackson’s script featured a little boy holding the hand of an older man on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while 50 pop stars, including </span> <b> <span __num="516" __label="true"> Britney Spears </span> </b> <span __num="517" __label="true"> and </span> <b> <span __num="518" __label="true"> Carlos Santana </span> </b> <span __num="519" __label="true"> , sang the treacly song in the shadow of America’s 16th president. There was just one snag: in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Washington’s memorial sites were closed or heavily secured. According to </span> <b> <span __num="520" __label="true"> Joe Becker </span> </b> <span __num="521" __label="true"> , a </span> <i> <span __num="522" __label="true"> West Wing </span> </i> <span __num="523" __label="true"> producer enlisted to work on the video for Jackson’s tribute, Kuo was the team’s “man in the White House.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="524" __label="true"> Despite the lockdown, Jackson and Schaffel were cleared to make the video at the site. “Representatives of the Parks Service said that the go ahead for us to use the Lincoln Memorial had come straight from the White House,” Becker recalls, adding that Jackson returned Kuo’s favor by providing backstage passes to a concert at RFK Stadium in D.C., and that the presidential adviser then “invited members of my staff to the concert and had them over to the White House mess hall for lunches.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="525" __label="true"> In the end, the project was scuttled after Schaffel’s XXX-rated resume became public. Becker says he lost $120,000 of his own money that he had invested in the filming, expecting to be reimbursed. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="526" __label="true"> “When it came out that Schaffel was in gay porn and that Jackson had some serious legal problems, Kuo tried to act like he never knew them,” Becker said. “It would have been laughable if I hadn’t been taken for all that money.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="527" __label="true"> Reached for comment, Kuo acknowledged that he had met with both Schaffel and Jackson about the tribute—”I met with hundreds of people a week at the White House”—but denied that he had helped gain them access to the Lincoln Memorial. “After 9/11 the White House was tasked with reaching out to people from the charitable world and Jackson had gotten in touch with us about some song that he was doing just like he had done ‘We are the World,’” Kuo said. “I didn’t have a relationship with either guy, and I never invited staff on the project to come eat lunch at the cafeteria.” </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="528" __label="true"> Kuo claims that concert promoter Clear Channel, not Jackson, provided his backstage passes to the RFK concert. And his opinion of Jackson? “I met him for a few minutes,” Kuo said, “and I had no particular reaction.” Kuo insisted that as far as he knew, no pedophilia charges had been brought against Jackson at the time. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="529" __label="true"> Kuo has since stepped down from the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to take a contributing editor position at </span> <a href="http://www.beliefnet.org/story/160/story_16092_1.html" target="_blank"> <span __num="530" __label="true"> beliefnet.org </span> </a> <span __num="531" __label="true"> , which </span> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24561-2005Feb14.html" target="_blank"> <span __num="532" __label="true"> recently published his attack </span> </a> <span __num="533" __label="true"> on the administration for not doing enough for religious groups (“There was minimal senior White House commitment to the faith-based agenda,” he wrote).

      <p> <span __num="536" __label="true"> Though the pundits have all but ordained her as the Democrats’ next presidential nominee, it hasn’t been all smooth sailing for Sen. </span> <b> <span __num="537" __label="true"> Hillary Clinton </span> </b> <span __num="538" __label="true"> . Publicly at least, the junior Senator from New York still insists she hasn’t made up her mind about a presidential run. But while her coy denials and growing war chest have kept many Democratic opponents on the sidelines, at least one party poobah has not been shy about checking out her competition. Sources close to the Democratic National Committee claim that </span> <b> <span __num="539" __label="true"> Bill Clinton </span> </b> <span __num="540" __label="true"> has recently held a series of secret meetings with Virginia Gov. </span> <b> <span __num="541" __label="true"> Mark Warner </span> </b> <span __num="542" __label="true"> , a much-hyped party moderate who is rapidly emerging as his wife’s most significant challenger for the Democratic nomination. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="543" __label="true"> The affable, press-friendly Warner recently sealed his star status in the party after engineering the election of his lieutenant governor, </span> <b> <span __num="544" __label="true"> Tim Kaine </span> </b> <span __num="545" __label="true"> , to take his place in the governor’s mansion, handing the Dems one of their most significant electoral victories in traditionally red-state Virginia earlier this month. Sources say the former president has grown enamored of Warner, a detail-oriented policy wonk who, like Clinton, rose to prominence as the moderate governor of a conservative Southern state. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="546" __label="true"> Even as she fights off competition from the right, Hillary has other problems to worry about. As a host of prospective opponents, including senators </span> <b> <span __num="547" __label="true"> John Kerry </span> </b> <span __num="548" __label="true"> , </span> <b> <span __num="549" __label="true"> Joe Biden </span> </b> <span __num="550" __label="true"> , and </span> <b> <span __num="551" __label="true"> Barack Obama </span> </b> <span __num="552" __label="true"> , have lined up to demand a swift departure from Iraq, Mrs. Clinton’s stay-the-course message has eroded her support among the party’s progressives. Furious over her refusal to join a growing chorus of Democratic voices calling for an immediate withdrawal,&nbsp;a few leading party doves are accusing the former first lady of putting politics before principle in an effort to cultivate New York’s Jewish vote. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="553" __label="true"> “I think a lot of Democrats were surprised when she said that we should stay in Iraq at least through the December Iraqi elections,” says one high-level party insider. “But you can’t win New York State without the support of the state’s pro-Israel Jewish community.” While pundits claim that Democrat contendors historically need two thirds of the Jewish vote in New York to win a Senate campaign, Clinton received a mere 53 percent in her 2000 run against </span> <b> <span __num="554" __label="true"> Rick Lazio </span> </b> <span __num="555" __label="true"> —a scare she presumably doesn’t want to see repeated. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="556" __label="true"> But the senator’s supporters dismiss this charge as “ridiculous,” pointing out that polls show that the state’s Jewish community is as divided about the war as the general electrorate is. “It’s just race baiting,” claims an aggreived Clinton pal who is outraged by the Washington whisper campaign. “Their justified opposition to the war has caused them to adopt the GOP’s worst tactics, but the poll numbers disprove the whole theory.” </span> </p>
