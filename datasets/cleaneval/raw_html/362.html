It serves as a reference group for the network on strategies to address problems of child domestic workers in the region. Under the leadership of Visayan Forum Foundation as Convenor since its inception in 1996, it and its members have had an impressive record of advocating for greater visibility and treatment of the issue in the region. It is a regular collaborator with ILO-IPEC and Anti-Slavery International and has worked with these organizations extensively on experience sharing, research, and advocacy initiatives. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="2" __label="true"> In its efforts to address and raise awareness of the issues relating to child domestic workers the Task Force has set the following priorities for 2002-2005: </span> </p> <p> <span __num="3"> 1. </span> <em> <span __num="4" __label="true"> Research and policy framework </span> </em> <span __num="5" __label="true"> , including the development and promotion of good practices. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="6"> 2. </span> <em> <span __num="7" __label="true"> Documentation and sharing of information </span> </em> <span __num="8" __label="true"> , especially through a website and a circular. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="9"> 3. </span> <em> <span __num="10" __label="true"> Advocacy </span> </em> <span __num="11" __label="true"> on the development and enforcement of standards (including legislation), working with employers, with a focus on education and child participation. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="12"> 4. </span> <em> <span __num="13" __label="true"> Capacity building </span> </em> <span __num="14" __label="true"> of existing and new Task Force members, including child domestic workers and their associations. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="15"> 5. </span> <em> <span __num="16" __label="true"> Networking and linkaging </span> </em> <span __num="17" __label="true"> towards influencing institutions at national, regional, and international levels. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="18"> 6. </span> <em> <span __num="19" __label="true"> Strengthening and linking, developing programs, and generating attention and action </span> </em> <span __num="20" __label="true"> towards attacking the connection between trafficking and children as well as adults' entry into domestic work. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Its activities focus on the collection and focus of field experience and strategies and capacity building and delivery of these experiences for advocacy. </span> </p> <p> <strong> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Regional Consultations and Field Exchanges </span> </strong> </p> <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> The 1st Regional Consultation on Child Domestic Workers was held in 1997 and was the first coordinated activity of the Task Force.
