   <font face="Arial"> <p align="CENTER"> <strong> <span __num="1" __label="true"> Doing Away with Pretexts Justifying the Unlawful Behaviour </span> </strong> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="2" __label="true"> Islam, and generally all other religions, are not contentwith simple declarations or warnings with respect to unlawful or harmful activity andbehaviour. They are eager to prevent and eliminate the means leading to such activity andbehaviour. In this context, Muslim jurists formulated a legal principle known asSadd-u-Thara'ie, which means, in practical terms, closing the doors or removing the meanswhich lead to what is unlawful. This principle entails the prohibition of certainsubstances or activities for the simple reason that they would lead to a forbidden actionor behaviour. Some of these substances and activities might not be unlawful in themselves,but they become subject to prohibition when they can lead to some other activity that isexpressly forbidden. </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="3" __label="true"> The object of this ruling is to "cleanse the socialatmosphere of all provocative agents of temptation and sensuality and causes of deviantbehaviour, as far as possible </span> <sup> <span __num="4" __label="true"> " </span> <a href="References.htm#26"> <span __num="5"> (26) </span> </a> <span __num="6" __label="true"> . </span> </sup> <span __num="7" __label="true"> Inthemselves, these agents may be prohibited, permissible or even recommended. </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="8" __label="true"> There could not be a more appropriate approach in the area ofsensual and sexual desires and gratification. Without it, the requirement to refrain fromunlawful sexual activity would be onerous, and could be even self-defeating. Religiousteachings are normally geared to alleviate hardship and facilitate a clean and chastelife. The Quran emphasizes " </span> <i> <span __num="9" __label="true"> God does not wish to overburden you; He seeks only topurify you" </span> </i> <span __num="10" __label="true"> (5:6). </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Among the practices and types of behaviour to which theprinciple of Sadd-u-Thara`ie applies and which relate to the prohibition of sexualactivity outside proper marriage, are: </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="12" __label="true"> 6.1 Entering people's houses without their permission.This is prohibited as theQuran says: " </span> <i> <span __num="13" __label="true"> Believers, do not enter homes other than your own until you havepermission to do so and wish peace to their dwellers. That is best for you, if you wouldonly reflect. lf you find no one in them, do not enter them until you are given permissionto do so. lf you </span> </i> <span __num="14" __label="true"> are </span> <i> <span __num="15" __label="true"> told to leave, then go away, for it is right for you so to do.God is avware of 'what you do" </span> </i> <span __num="16" __label="true"> (Light: 27-28). </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="17" __label="true"> 6.2 The directives to lower one's gaze and not look at those parts of the humanbody that could arouse sensual feelings. This is clearly laid down in the Quran </span> <i> <span __num="18" __label="true"> :"Tell the believing men to turn their eyes away ( from carnal temptation ) andpreserve their chastity. It would make them pure. God knows what they do . Tell thebelieving women to turn their eyes away (from carnal temptation) and preserve theirchastity, to cover their adornment, except such as is normally visible of it, to drawtheir clothes properly over their bodies, not to reveal their beauty to anyone except totheir husbands, their fathers, their husbands' father, their sons, step-sons, brothers,nephews, their women folk or slave-girls, their male-attendants lacking in sexual driveand children who have no appreciation of women's nakedness. Let them also not move theirlegs when walking, so as to draw attention to their hidden charms. Believers, you shouldall repent to God, that </span> </i> <i> <span __num="19" __label="true"> you may prosper" </span> </i> <span __num="20" __label="true"> (Light: 30-31). </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Commentators on the Quran have indicated that, the above injunction is a commandfrom God to His believing servants to turn their eyes away from what is not permissiblefor them to look at and only enjoy looking at what they are allowed to see. If one's eyesfall inadvertently on something that is not permissible to look at one must immediatelyturn one's eyes away </span> <sup> <a href="References.htm#27"> <span __num="22"> (27) </span> </a> <span __num="23" __label="true"> , </span> </sup> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="24" __label="true"> The </span> <i> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Sunnah </span> </i> <span __num="26" __label="true"> of the Prophet confirms this view. Muslim and others havereported that Jareer ibn Abdullah al-Bujali asked the Prophet ( peace be on him ) aboutthe inadvertent glance. The Prophet replied, " </span> <i> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Turn your eyes away </span> </i> <span __num="28" __label="true"> " </span> <a href="References.htm#28"> <sup> <span __num="29"> (28) </span> </sup> </a> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="30" __label="true"> 6.3 The display of charms and adornments. This is forbidden under this heading.It is not lawful for a woman to reveal too much or to deliberately try to attract men'seyes and their admiration. Such behaviour nullifies the effect of the injunction not tolook at women lustfully and defeats the objectives of spreading virtue and cleansingsociety of all lewd and sinful practices. </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="31" __label="true"> 6.4 The prohibition of sweet and sensual talk in women's conversation with men. </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="32" __label="true"> 6.5 The encouragement of modesty, describing it as a branch of faith. TheProphet said, " </span> <i> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Faith consists of some and sixty or some and seventy points thefirst of which is the testimony that there is no deity but God and the last of which ispicking up litterfrom people's path. Modesty is one of these points of faith </span> </i> <sup> <span __num="34" __label="true"> " </span> <a href="References.htm#29"> <span __num="35"> (29) </span> </a> <span __num="36" __label="true"> . </span> </sup> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="37" __label="true"> The concept of modesty refers to man's natural feeling of shame when leaningtowards committing something unlawful. This feeling acts as a deterrent against committingit. Whenever someone's instinctive desires have the best of him, one's inner sense ofshame is revived, conscience awakened and ability to reflect, refrain or repent,hightened. </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="38" __label="true"> All ethical teachings and instruction of Islam are aimed at invigoratingand supporting this intrinsic quality of human nature, and making it stronger withknowledge, understanding and feeling. The purpose is to make it part of the moral fabricof man's personality, and to protect and guard man's moral well-being The Prophet says:" </span> <i> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Every religion has a basic </span> </i> <i> <span __num="40" __label="true"> code of morals, and the basic moral code ofIslam is modesty </span> </i> <span __num="41" __label="true"> " </span> <sup> <a href="References.htm#30"> <span __num="42"> (30) </span> </a> <span __num="43" __label="true"> . </span> </sup> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Another </span> <i> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Hadith </span> </i> <span __num="46" __label="true"> says: " </span> <i> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Modesty can only bring about goodness </span> </i> <span __num="48" __label="true"> " </span> <a href="References.htm#31"> <sup> <span __num="49"> (31) </span> </sup> </a> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="50" __label="true"> Modesty brings together all the characteristics of goodness in human nature andis an effective protection against all evil. The Prophet, ( peace be on him) was full ofadmiration for those whose modesty was reflected in their behaviour. He always urged hiscompanions to develop this precious moral quality. </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Christianity also teaches and advocates moral ideals similar to those espousedby Islam. We read in the Old Testament: " </span> <i> <span __num="52" __label="true"> You shall not covet your neighbour's wife </span> </i> <span __num="53" __label="true"> "(Exodus: 20,17; Deuteronomy: 5,21). According to the New Testament, " </span> <i> <span __num="54" __label="true"> Every one wholooks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" </span> </i> <span __num="55" __label="true"> (Matthew, 5: 28). Christian teachings are full of high moral directives that provide for aclean and chaste human life. One of the most powerful of such exhortations is found in St.Paul's Letter to the Thessalonians (4:3-8) in which he says to them, " </span> <i> <span __num="56" __label="true"> For this isthe will of God, your sanctification: that you </span> </i> <i> <span __num="57" __label="true"> abstain from immorality; . . .Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his holy spiritto you". </span> </i> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="58" __label="true"> St. Peter the Apostle confirms this in his First Letter when he says: </span> <i> <span __num="59" __label="true"> 'Beloved,I beseech you as aliens and exriles to abstain from the passions of the flesh that wagewar against </span> </i> <i> <span __num="60" __label="true"> your soul. Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles </span> </i> <span __num="61" __label="true"> . . ."(Peter 1: 2,11) He also says in the same Letter, ". . . </span> <i> <span __num="62" __label="true"> do not be conformed to thepassions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves inall your conduct; since it is written, 'You shall be holy' for I am holy" </span> </i> <span __num="63" __label="true"> (Peter1 :1, l 5). </span> </small> </p> <p> <small> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Thus we see that the teachings of both Islam and Christianity do not stop atadvocating virtue, extolling and praising all that lead to it, and condemning immoralityand all sinful activity that lead to it. Both religions go further than that and condemnthe mere contemplation of sin or allowing oneself to be subject to its temptation. </span> </small> </p> </font> 
   <p> <font face="Arial"> <small> <span __num="65" __label="true"> Adherence to religious moral injunctions in avoiding immoral and sinfulpractices is not portrayed simply as a way leading to happiness in the Hereafter only. ithas a role to play in the enhancement of the physical and moral purification of the humanpersonality in this world as well. The Quran encourages certain actions because they aremore " </span> <i> <span __num="66" __label="true"> wholesome" </span> </i> <span __num="67" __label="true"> and " </span> <i> <span __num="68" __label="true"> purer </span> </i> <span __num="69" __label="true"> ", praises those wno obey asbeing " </span> <i> <span __num="70" __label="true"> goodly men and women </span> </i> <span __num="71" __label="true"> ". Disobedient individuals are described as" </span> <i> <span __num="72" __label="true"> wicked men and women </span> </i> <span __num="73" __label="true"> ". These distinctions are made on the basis that theformer have respected and observed God's messages and acted accordingly, while the latterhave succumbed to their desires, and strayed away. In trying to satisfy their naturaldesires they have not been content with what is permissible and acceptable. They have letloose their desires and indulged in what is sinful and forbidden. Ii is sufficient as amotivation to abide by the religious commandmen that one earns the quality of being " </span> <i> <span __num="74" __label="true"> goodly </span> </i> <span __num="75" __label="true"> "as a result. Similarly, being called " </span> <i> <span __num="76" __label="true"> wicked </span> </i> <span __num="77" __label="true"> " provides the incentive tosteer away from sin. Such descriptions in religious books provide the right motivation forpeople with conscience and sincerity to bring their conduct in line with their beliefs. </span> </small> </font> </p>
