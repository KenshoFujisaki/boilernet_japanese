These students will need to obtain approval from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly known as the INS) before starting school. Before, foreign students could submit applications for student status but begin school before receiving the USCIS's okay. Under the new rule, USCIS promises to issue its approvals (or denials) within approximately 30 days -- in return for which it requires applicants to wait for its decision before starting school. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="133" __label="true"> Another major change for international students is the setup of the SEVIS system, a database into which the schools will enter information on students, which USCIS can then access via the Internet. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="134" __label="true"> In theory, students should hardly notice this change, except that it puts them under pressure to inform their foreign student officers quickly of any changes in their address, student status, or other relevant information. In practice, the system has caused frustration, as information doesn't always get entered into the system accurately. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="135" __label="true"> In addition, international students are being closely monitored. When a school issues an I-20 to a student, it will be required to notify the U.S. consulate in the student's home country. When that consulate approves the student's visa, it will be required to notify the USCIS. During the student's time at school, the school will have to keep the USCIS up to date on the student's status and whereabouts through a database called SEVIS. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> To finance this database, international students now must pay $100 in addition to the usual visa fees. The information and documents that schools are required to make available to USCIS include each international student's: </span> </p>

The main difference is that the photos must be bigger -- two inches square, with your head measuring between 1 inch and 1 3/8 inches. In addition, the State Department emphasizes that they want to see the applicant's full head, including hair and, if possible, ears. Head coverings and hats are only acceptable when due to the person's religious beliefs, and even then may not cover any portion of the applicant's face. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="151" __label="true"> Also, photocopies of photographs will not be accepted. Digitally reproduced photos must be of high qualify, with no visible pixels or dot patterns. The photo must be stapled or glued directly on to Form DS-156 in the designated space. </span> </p> <h4> <span __num="152" __label="true"> Changed Your Address? The Immigration Authorities Want to Know Right Away </span> </h4> <p> <span __num="153" __label="true"> In 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS, now know as the USCIS) started to enforce little-known provisions of the immigration law that make it a crime for immigrants not to submit immediate notifications whenever they change their address. The potential punishments include fines, imprisonment, or deportation. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="154" __label="true"> Here's how to protect yourself: First, figure out whether the law applies to you. It covers all foreign nationals who've been in the United States for more than 30 days, including those with: </span> </p> 
                     <ul type="disc"> 
                      <li> <span __num="155" __label="true"> nonimmigrant status (a temporary visa or permission to be in the United States, including a student visa, visitor visa, asylum or refugee status, and more), with the exception of those with an A or G visa </span> </li>

                     </ul> <p> <span __num="158" __label="true"> The USCIS requires that you use Form AR-11, sending it to a special address set up to handle the mountain of forms it's receiving. And you can't just send one form per family -- every member of your household needs to have a separate form submitted for him or her. The form and the address to which it must be sent are on the USCIS website (in various languages) at </span> <a href="http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/ar-11.htm"> <span __num="159" __label="true"> http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/ar-11.htm </span> </a> <span __num="160" __label="true"> . </span> </p> <p> <span __num="161" __label="true"> Form AR-11 itself is fairly self-explanatory. If you don't have an A-number (a number the USCIS assigns to people who've applied for green cards or have been in removal proceedings), either ignore this question or supply your I-94 number. The question about your last address refers only to your last address in the United States, not overseas. The address you supply should be where you actually live, not a P.O. Box or work address. There is no fee for filing Form AR-11. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="162" __label="true"> If you have any applications on file that are waiting for a USCIS decision -- for example, youve applied for a work permit -- you need to file the change of address form at whichever USCIS office is handling your application. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="163" __label="true"> The time window for filing your change of address is only ten days from the date of your move. What if more than ten days have already passed and youve only just discovered your responsibility? Most attorneys advise that you fill out the form now, to show the USCIS you made an attempt to comply and to assure that it has your current address. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="164" __label="true"> Be sure to make a photocopy of your Form AR-11 and any notifications you send to other USCIS offices. Then mail everything by certified mail with a return receipt. The return receipt is particularly important because the USCIS won't send you any separate acknowledgment that it has received your form. </span> </p> <h4> <span __num="165" __label="true"> Full Middle Name Now Required in All Immigration Forms </span> </h4> <p> <span __num="166" __label="true"> For security reasons, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly known as the INS) now asks everyone submitting applications to write in their full middle name -- not just their middle initial. USCIS would like you to do this even if the form you're filling out only asks for your middle initial. If you forget, your application won't be denied, but you will get a letter asking for your full middle name, which is guaranteed to slow down the USCIS's final decision on your application. </span> </p> <h4> <span __num="167" __label="true"> Young Men Applying for Tourist or Student Visas Must File Extra Form </span> </h4> <p> <span __num="168" __label="true"> Responding to concerns about the involvement of young men in terrorist acts in the United States, the State Department in 2002 instituted stricter visa requirements for males. All 16- to 45-year-old male applicants for "nonimmigrant" (temporary) visas now have to submit Form DS-157 in addition to the usual application materials. This will affect mainly those applying for student and tourist visas. To get a copy of the new form, go to the State Department's website at </span> <a href="http://www.state.gov/"> <span __num="169" __label="true"> www.state.gov </span> </a> <span __num="170" __label="true"> . Click on "Visas," then click "Visa Application Forms" and look for Form DS-157. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="171" __label="true"> This new form will be mandatory for young men from all countries in the world, not just for men from countries suspected of terrorist links. However, men from Middle Eastern countries are facing longer waits for visas than other applicants. </span> </p> <h4> <span __num="172" __label="true"> Check Your Immigration Application's Progress Online </span> </h4> <p> <span __num="173" __label="true"> You can now check the status of your application online, at </span> <a href="https://egov.immigration.gov/cris/jsps/index.jsp"> <span __num="174" __label="true"> https://egov.immigration.gov/cris/jsps/index.jsp </span> </a> <span __num="175" __label="true"> . Be forewarned, however -- unless your computer has a fairly new browser, you will not be able to access this service. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="176" __label="true"> Once you've accessed the appropriate Web page, you will need the application receipt number from your USCIS receipt notice. If the USCIS has failed to send you a receipt notice, you are unfortunately stuck with using the old phone system. </span> </p> <h4> <span __num="177" __label="true"> Revised Forms Required for Many Immigration Applications </span> </h4> <p> <span __num="178" __label="true"> U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly called the INS) and the U.S. State Department regularly revise the forms used for immigration applications. The new versions of some of these forms must be used instead of the old versions, even if the changes to the form are minor. In some cases, the agency will accept an earlier version of the form for a while. If you do use an earlier version for some reason, be careful when following the instructions -- in particular, the fees stated on the form are likely to have gone up. In addition, there are some new forms: </span> </p> 
                     <ul type="disc"> 
                      <li> <strong> <span __num="179" __label="true"> Form DS-158, Contact Information and Work History for Nonimmigrant Visa Applicant. </span> </strong> <span __num="180" __label="true"> This form is now required of all applicants for F, M, or J student visas. It collects family and employment information. </span> </li> 
                      <li> <strong> <span __num="181" __label="true"> Form DS-157, Supplemental Nonimmigrant Visa Application. </span> </strong> <span __num="182" __label="true"> This form is now required of all male applicants for nonimmigrant visas who are between the ages of 16 and 45, regardless of which country they are from. It is designed to bring out information regarding potential terrorist tendencies. </span> </li> 
                     </ul> <p> <span __num="183" __label="true"> And there's one form you no longer need to send yourself: Form I-538, the certification by your designated school official (DSO) that must accompany applications requesting a school transfer, reinstatement of status, or various work permits. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="184" __label="true"> The new SEVIS computer system allows your DSO, in most cases, to transmit his or her certification directly to USCIS, without using the Form I-538. Your school may nevertheless ask you to fill out your portion of the form, for its files. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="185" __label="true"> Copies of new USCIS forms (indicated by the initial letter "I") can be obtained from your local USCIS office or by calling USCIS at 800-870-3676. You can also access the latest USCIS forms online at </span> <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/"> <span __num="186" __label="true"> www.uscis.gov </span> </a> <span __num="187" __label="true"> (click on "Immigration Forms, Fees and Fingerprints," then on "Forms and Fees," and scroll down until you find the appropriate form). </span> </p> <p> <span __num="188" __label="true"> Copies of new State Department forms (indicated by the initial letters "DS") can be obtained from your local consulate. </span> </p> <h4> <span __num="189" __label="true"> Visa Waiver Entrants Will Need Passports Containing Biometric Information </span> </h4> <p> <span __num="190" __label="true"> If you're planning to visit the United States using a visa waiver rather than an actual visa, you may need to get a new passport first. Starting October 26, 2005, all visa waiver entrants must present passports containing a digital photograph. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="191" __label="true"> By the following year, October 26, 2006, they'll need to have passports containing other biometric information (probably fingerprints), to be announced later. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="192" __label="true"> Unfortunately, not all countries whose citizens are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program have the technology to provide this type of passport.
