              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="21" __label="true"> There are some disadvantages in being the one who is divorced. Firstly, you can be ordered to pay the legal fees for the divorce; this may seem (and often is) extremely unfair, a case of adding injury to insult. This is based on the old principle in the courts that if you prove your case then you get your costs, despite the fact that it is not always appropriate in the family justice system. However, if the practicalities of the actual divorce are agreed by both parties, it is also possible to agree that the two of you will share the legal fees between you, or indeed that the person who actually files the petition will not seek an order for costs against the spouse. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="22" __label="true"> Secondly, you may have the unpleasantness of being on the receiving end of some legal description of your private life, especially if the divorce is based on unreasonable behaviour. It is possible to file an Answer to the allegations and try to regain control of the process by forcing a compromise on the allegations made, but most prefer to avoid the legal complications and significant expense of doing so. Nevertheless, allegations made as to unreasonable behaviour do often stick in the gullet as the contents of the Petition rarely have much to do with why the marriage broke down. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="23" __label="true"> But who petitions against whom rarely spills over in to other more important areas, such as the children or finance. It is worth just checking that none of the allegations in the Petition relate to dealing with the children or to financial issues, since once the divorce is granted, those allegations become a finding of fact. Unless it is specifically agreed beforehand, these findings can be referred to in linked proceedings. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="24" __label="true"> The usual way of preventing such difficulties - and much acrimony too - is to offer the Petition in draft before it is sent to the court. Any items that cause particular upset can be discussed and either watered down or left out. This is not something that everyone has to do, but is very much in the spirit of the SFLA Code of Practice. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="25" __label="true"> An early discussion with an SFLA solicitor can help resolve some of these issues. </span> </font> </small> </p>

              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> If the divorce is going to take place in England and Wales, it is possible to get any County Court that is empowered to deal with divorce to issue proceedings. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="33" __label="true"> It is usual to use your local court for convenience's sake. Some use a court that is out of their area for fear of coming into contact with people they know in the local context (Mrs Simpson used Ipswich!). The Principal Registry in London is used by many who do not live there, for a mixture of all of these reasons or perhaps they believe that that court will handle their case better. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="34" __label="true"> Practices and judicial attitudes vary from court to court. Experienced solicitors with knowledge of the system sometimes choose a particular court for a particular case, to try and gain some advantage for their client. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="35" __label="true"> But for the vast majority of cases it is convenience that is the deciding factor - convenience for the solicitors particularly, since they will charge for their travel time to court. In any event courts have the power to order cases to be transferred to the court that is most appropriate - in the view of the judge rather than anyone else. </span> </font> </small> </p>

In considering which parent is best able to meet the child's best interests, the Court will apply the "welfare checklist" (s1(3) Children Act 1989). </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="40" __label="true"> The application of the Welfare Checklist points towards pragmatism: </span> </font> </small> </p>

This last consideration is often fundamental and traditionally, has tended to work in favour of mothers, but increasingly, this need not necessarily be the case. </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Even where one parent does have a Residence Order in his or her favour, that does not alter the fact that the other parent retains parental responsibility and has an important role to play in the child's life. In theory at least, a Residence Order is not a passport to making important decisions about the child's upbringing on a unilateral basis. </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="45" __label="true"> In the case of unmarried parents, the mother has sole parental responsibility until the father acquires it by way of an agreement, or Court Order.

               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="46" __label="true"> In the case of very young children, it is a fact that courts tend to assume they are better off living with their mother unless clearly shown to the contrary. Nevertheless, there is no presumption of law and the courts have to consider each case on its individual merits. Although the odds may seem stacked against a father, the facts may mean that this is not necessarily the case. </span> </font> </small> </li>

              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Recent cases concerning 'big money' - where the assets available for division clearly exceed the parties' needs - have focused on the concept of equality of outcome. This may or may not mean that the assets are divided 50/50 in these cases. What it does mean is that contributions to the running of the home and the bringing up of children are valued equally by the court on divorce to contributions made by economically rewarding work. There may be other considerations - for example, the liquidity of the assets making up the family pot, or any inheritances received, or particularly bad financial conduct on one side, which dictate that the outcome should not be equal. Fairness is the key - and a 50/50 split will not be fair in all cases. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="50" __label="true"> Each case has to be looked at individually.

              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="89" __label="true"> Neither parent, nor indeed any other person, can change a child’s surname without the written consent of every person with parental responsibility or the leave of the Court. Even in cases where the parents are unmarried, the Court has suggested that such a step should generally not be taken without either the other parent's agreement or a court decision. Changing a child’s surname is obviously a very emotive step, since the surname may provide an important link to the parent with whom the child does not normally live; it may also express a preference to be known as the child of the step-parent. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="90" __label="true"> The Court will not consider it appropriate to change a child’s surname just because it is different to that of their half–or–step-siblings, nor even simply because the child wants it changed. The Court will not sanction a change in surname lightly; there is a presumption in favour of the status quo. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Increasingly, children may be part of a step-family in which children do not all share the same surname. It is therefore important that any such proposal is very carefully thought through and justifiable on quite strict grounds, such as where there is no ongoing relationship whatsoever with the other biological parent and so to retain that name causes distress and confusion. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="92" __label="true"> The uppermost consideration for the Court in considering whether a change of surname is appropriate is the child’s welfare and best interests. It is everything to do with the rights of the child and nothing to do with any asserted parental rights. How those best interests are met will depend upon balancing a range of factors including: </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <ul> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="93" __label="true"> the original surname with which the child was registered and whether all the circumstances justify such a change (ie. is there a good enough reason?); </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="94" __label="true"> whether the change of name has already happened and how long ago; </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="95" __label="true"> the age of the child involved and whether he or she is deemed competent to understand the complexity of issues arising; </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="96" __label="true"> the need to preserve a link between the child and the non-residential parent, regardless of contact arrangements; </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="97" __label="true"> whether the reaction of either parent to the decision and any consequences would cause practical detriment to the child; </span> </font> </small> </li> 
               <li> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="98" __label="true"> the strength of the child's connection with the current surname. </span> </font> </small> </li> 
              </ul> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="99" __label="true"> In certain instances the Court has made a distinction between a child’s "official" name and the name by which the child chooses to be known; this to be particularly relevant with an older child, although the parents themselves would be obliged not to cause them to be known by anything other than the official name. However, in another case involving teenage children the Court decided that the father’s surname should be kept in the face of opposition from the children and in circumstances where no contact was taking place in order to underline the importance of the paternal link. </span> </font> </small> </p> 
              <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="100" __label="true"> Inevitably, the issue continues to be a difficult and highly emotionally-charged one to resolve, but one in which the Court considers it important enough to be involved where the parents cannot agree. </span> </font> </small> </p>
