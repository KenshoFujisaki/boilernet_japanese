theres no way she could go, she was workin too much in an attempt to live a life tat she wanted, a life free of all the crap that surrounded her, and anyways, if she was gone for more than twelve ours, the people she was staying with would put her on a missing person’s list and she would be dragged home. but got a similar statement fromn her: "dude, go i’ll make it up to you when you come

off of e-bay, i went to filenes with my gold chain wallet and coughed up $185.50 for the three day pass. all the money coming from my scholarship i was presented to by the good people at </span> <a

height="220" src="../../../images/woodstock/ticket_master.jpg" width="279"> </a> </p> <p> <span __num="29" __label="true"> we actually met up with two people we were supposed to meet up with, a twenty three year old girl who wouldn’t stop talkin bout her boyfriend and her mother, who had total control of her life. be in their car they had a radar dectector, guaranteeing a speeding trek across the native american named cities and counties of upper NY, so it was all coo, till we found ourselves stuck behind them for hours on end in the left lane goin 55, angry people behind us, angry people in the car, actually, just kelly and i, kelly used to getting passed once a trip, flooring that blue tercel, now stranded behind a prism with a homemade psychedelic "woodstock or bust" poster. the second rest stop we went to, we decided to lead with our car, and as i dozed, we somehow lost the other car, i looked at the speedometer, a cool 85, as the the tercel began to shake and vibrate from the shear magnitude that 12 cylinder beast mustered up. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="30" __label="true"> we made it to rome at a pitiful time, it was 730, the air was cool but choking with anticipation and fumes of cars full of rampumctious youngins just ichin to have a good time. traffic was extremely tolerable, we parked right by one of two stages, and walked with our belongings : </span> <br> </p> <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> me, sleeping bag, 3 shirts, snowpants (i dunno either) long underwear, 2 pairs shorts, two pair pants, no extra boxers or shoes, </span> </p> <p> <a

sleeping bag, one person tent, food (p+j, two loaves of bread, rice crispie treats, crackers) clothes, lactaid pills. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="33" __label="true"> we were set, be prepared my mom/scout leader told us, yeah we’ll make it 5 days, no problem. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="34" __label="true"> it took about an hour to walk around the whole airport/concert area to get to our campsite, loo did we know, this little excursion would be just routine. they checked for no metal, no glass, no cans, but didn’t care bout drug at all, and i really didn’t care. i’d rather have 200,000 lazy tired paranoid people around me as i wandered throught ny’s third largest city than having a quarter mil drunken people slobbering around me, beer couldn’t be brought in cause of the container, but rest assured they were sold at $5 so all the rich kids could get their kicks, hey it was cheaper then water. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?&amp;csz=Rome,+NY" target="out"> <img border="0" height="337" src="../../../images/woodstock/woodstock_map.jpg" width="482"> </a> <br> <span __num="35" __label="true"> pitched tent in the slapdash tenement, tried to figure out the spider web road system, and went out to wander the vendors, concession stands and music that had already started early. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> checked out all the hippy bead places, hot dog stands and saw parliament funkadelic. good day. i guess a local radio station was given out free woodstock frisbees in mass. i small corner of woodstock’s airspace turned into the testing ground for 300 frisbees to fly this way and that, the effect was curiously calming and just a taste of what the vibe would be for the weekend, just everything goin everywhere but nothing horrible happening, just enough anarchy to have a good time. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="37" __label="true"> found the tent and found some visual cues to tip us off.... </span> </p> <p> <span __num="38" __label="true"> yellow caution tape mucked around a tree... crappy bright orange tent before ours... flying high tie dye wearing college student on the fence... ok, all set. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="39" __label="true"> got up early, too early, the sun touching the tent made an instant humidity machine, i woke up sweating from my chest and stuck to my coleman sleeping bag, getting up to see our once vacant campsite full and new neighbors to meet. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.tattootheearth.com" target="out"> <img align="left" border="0" height="200" src="../../../images/woodstock/tatoo_earth.jpg" width="264"> </a> <span __num="40" __label="true"> so kelly and i began to wander some more stands, saw the tatoo shop and watched some awful good looking girls go topless so some middle aged man could airbrush their chest to decency, at least woodstock decency. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="41" __label="true"> walked to the main stage to catch the ending of james brown getin down with his black self as the intermission gave me time to check, or steal someone's schedule to see the next band, jamiroquai, not my fav, but thi shat he had on and his dancin "cried homosexuality" as my girlfriend sez, but thats all good, he made me shake my ass and start off my day all soul funked out. live came next with their serious rock all about the water, they impressed me with their state of mind. sheryl crow came next, so we decided to get the fug outta there to eat or wander some more, anything's better than that. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="42" __label="true"> came back to see the last of dmx, and readied for a triple line up of the offspring, korn and bush. offspring was fun to listen with, honestly, safe punk for everybody, but they made nsync jokes so they were go enough for me, korn were kinda korny to me, i’m still with the opinion bloody beavis and butthead had with them being kinda unoriginal and lost in a soup of mirroring bands, but the lead singer guy was wearing a kilt, so big ups to that. kelly was totally in love with bush so we had to weasel ourselves to the tippidy front of the stage, i’ll have to admit that i thought gavin, the lead singer guy, was cute in a totally non homosexual way, and so 4 people to the front up went kelly to crowd surf to the front to leave me alone with her $300 elph camera singin to bushe’s cover of "this one goes out to the one i love" </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.peta.com" target="out"> <img align="left" border="0" height="128" src="../../../images/woodstock/chicken.jpg" width="130"> </a> <span __num="43" __label="true"> found moby was playing at the aircraft hanger rave afterwards, so after the show, i found the veggie burger stand, got one with everything, a big cookie, a frozen nonfat yogurt and icky food bar, then realizing i had 3 more days to survive the retardedly high prices and only seeing $20 of the $300 i took out in my wallet, oh well, guess i’ll just make alot more pb and j sandwiches.... </span> </p> <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> but made it to moby and moby was awesome. for a techno "artist" he came out with drummer, bass player and guitar and an odd assortment for himself, along wit hthe usual electronic keyboard thingy. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.peta.com" target="out"> <img align="right" border="0" height="151" src="../../../images/woodstock/small_chicken.jpg" width="152"> </a> <a href="http://www.hyperreal.org/music/artists/moby/" target="out"> <span __num="45" __label="true"> moby </span> </a> <span __num="46" __label="true"> was blazin on the guitar, bangin on the drums, makin good noise that made me happy happy. go see moby if you have a chance, that little vegan can make some good tunes. his last song(?) was just him and the computer, making a low, hollow beat the progressively got fast and faster while he stood up on the table and looked all krovy krovy scary with white lights mimicking campfire ghost story sessions. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> after moby, moby fan needed to get home, but home was hard to find after all that music and miles to walk with little knowledge of where mi was supposed to go. i literally was walking for an hour and a half through the maze of tents, people and port o potties tryin to find that damn tent, i gave up and decided to sleep in a corner under a huge american flag a tent circle brought, one of those monsters that you have to steal from a government building, and wait till the mourn. passing the same guy in the chair with the unsightly look on em, the same people playing the drums, the same 40 year old bastards tryin to get all the girls to show em their titties was too much. i turned around and saw in the trees the caution signs, turned slightly left, saw the crappy orange adobe, looked beyond, and their was my hokey tent, i climbed in at 4:00 am and woodstock day one ended. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.aranet.org" target="out"> <img align="left" border="0" height="173" src="../../../images/woodstock/racist.jpg" width="174"> </a> <span __num="48" __label="true"> i’m not sure when i got up, but it was way too early. at what was now the usual pb and j sandwhiches, the bananas were getting a little too ripe there, especially after i stepped on them from the night before. but such is life. saw this massachusettes band named guster, which was coo, got passed out free condoms which was excellent and checked out all the grassroots independent tents trying to make a difference. signed a million petitions on gun violence, abortion, kelly bought this weird thing you fill with water and it keeps you warm for ten dollars, we then found the same thing for 3 for ten dollars, heh heh. got miself to the anti racist action tent and saw all the cd’s that they were givin for donations and realized i had all of them cept 1, i made a note to buy it and this book on the philosophy of punk, good reading. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.aranet.org"> <img align="right" border="0" height="190" src="../../../images/woodstock/ssa_kcik.jpg" width="187"> </a> <span __num="49" __label="true"> counting crows was ahh... boring ("this is a song about when i was in my twenties and i wasn’t doing anything") , limp biscuit was unapologenically dumb, rage against the machine rocked (of course) and metallica got silly after the 4 </span> <sup> </sup> <span __num="50" __label="true"> t h encore. after metallica, i once again went back to the rave this time to see </span> <a href="http://www.astralwerks.com/fbs/" target="out"> <span __num="51" __label="true"> norman cook </span> </a> <span __num="52" __label="true"> , who i deemed the dork of woodstock. i got real close and saw how he mixed his rhymes, ciggarette in one hand, beer in the other, dopey buck toothed smile and horrible haircut, makin the jocks and hippies dance dance dance. i honestly don't know how he does what he does, it looked like he had like two turn tables, he'd take a live sample, screw around with it, make a transition from the last beat while looking at the crowd and flailing his arms, and unlesh his new tune, it was interesting, but got kinda boring when you have no room to dance and people wanted to crowd surf (?). </span> </p> <p> <span __num="53"> oi </span> </p> <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> got outta there in time to see the smoke from a fire near the mountain bike course lurking towards the aircraft hanger rave spot and found my way home first shot. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> third day last day, totally tired of my wet shoes, the bathrooms or lack of them, the cost of food, the smell of other peoples sweat on me, the amount of change i didn’t have, the fact that i had to go home, the fact that i didn’t know wat was up with my girlfriend. </span> </p> <p> <img align="right" height="97" src="../../../images/woodstock/fresh.jpg" width="97"> <span __num="56" __label="true"> did the last of the wandering of the stores, kelly finally got a green shirt she dug, i couldn’t find anything for my girl jess, for the quarters i found in my wallet, but i kept searching. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> saw elvis..... </span> </p> <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> costello, sat down twenty people away to listen to jewel yodel, kelly once again fell in love at the lead singer, this time of creed, and i got myself physched to see my favorite band of the show, the red hot chili peppers, </span> </p> <p> <img align="left" height="94" src="../../../images/woodstock/fresh_smile.jpg" width="94"> <span __num="59" __label="true"> i really wanted to be close for the peppers, got about 9 people away from the front, the feeling that there is 250,000 people trying to get to where you are is pretty core. i looked around my backside to see what the hell was sticking out and saw a mother and her two little children right in front of the stage. the mother was obviously in total delusion, thinking she would somehow make it through the set, she was trying to get all these tall strong guys near her for added protection. kelly and i noticed that we were surrounded by lots of teenage girls, which usually means that we’re in no fly zone for crowd surfers and mosh men. </span> </p> <p> <img align="left" height="551" src="../../../images/woodstock/bumpersticker.jpg" width="204"> <span __num="60" __label="true"> this being not the case as flea comes out stark naked and starts the chilli’s set. which rocked unequivetly, i sang with them in all there songs, as the crowd in back of me pushed with the force of the trojan army’s opponents. i had to hold on to kelly, who held on to anything she could to survive this total crushing force of the fans persecuted with the same conditions as i, but i didn’t care, the songs were good, the peppers were inside, anthony’s hair was bleach and short, the songs melancholy, funky and honest, the crowd fuckin crazy, the set seemed to short, the fires </span> </p> <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> the fires!? </span> <br> <span __num="62" __label="true"> before the planned encore by the red hot chili peppers, it was announced that there was a small fire near one of the towers and if we all cooperated the firetruck could go in and take it out, i looked around my shoulder and saw three nice blazing demons all scatter brick a brack around the whole place. earlier that day the pax tent, which worked for less gun violence in the usa, was giving away free candles for a vigil, i didn’t see no vigel, so i think everyone used them for the song "under the bridge" and then later these little waxy things made great starters,oop. the peppers i guess wanted to finish and they did, the only thing i could say that sucked was no higher ground, but a new tradition was made; all menstruating women had to throw their tampons on stage, i think i heard of that one before, but people did it, great another thing being thrown at me. </span> </p> <p> </p> <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> walking back after the last set was interesting. kelly’s sandled feet weren’t quite operational, so i offered to piggy back her all the way back to camp, missing the rioters, the fires, the drunken masses, just the masses, the people throwing whole tables and metal cans into the fire, the leaking bathrooms and drinking fountains. the fires were awesome, i totally dug the whole anarchy fuck everything mentality thang, i didn’t dig it when i thought of fires near my tent, and the rioters near the tent and the grrr.... not a happy night. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> finally got all set to collapse in my stinky sleeping bag with kelly, got into that nice happy floaty feeling and then i hear. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> "oh my god, get out get out!", </span> </p> <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> i look up to see about five people flying away from my tent. i honestly thought the tent next to me caught on fire, which wasn’t much of a leap of faith since they kept me up with their drunken/high/wasted philosophy about life and breakfast cereals, this guy’s laugh was unbearable, hyena like, uncontrollable crap. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> but lo, my fear/hopes faded just a bit as i saw it was a bunch of darn hooligans that stole one of the souped up golf carts to take a ride, he rode over one tent, which was vacant i think and got the fug outta there with a winter ass shade on his face just mowing throw everything. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="68" __label="true"> yells of, "i heard this is has been deemed a national disaster, the fuckin national gaurd is coming, their closing us off, we’re under martial law!!!" </span> <br> </p> <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> but i was tired, i put on my contacts just so the next time i get awaken by screams of tripping out girls or a tank rolls by, i could at least see myself die. i needed to get to work on monday, it was supposed to be my last day, i couldn’t miss that. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> 3 hours of sleep is all you need. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="71" __label="true"> i looked over to the tent next to me that was giving me hell. deserted. no one there. just a box of cereal samples, the collapsed tent, trash, (shit that stuff was everywhere) and a prize for me. three beat up bead necklaces. two purple, one green, showing the hellbent week in their condition, and free for me, perfect. i plan on telling an extrapolated version of that itty bit and give her the beads, maybe for a goodbye gift, maybe just to end a night of talking and holding each other. we’ll see... </span> </p> <p> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.nerve.com/tunick" target="out"> <img align="left" border="0"

i was filled with astonishment of the show i went to the people i saw, the good times, the fuckin bathrooms, the messed up showers, the bands the bands. a new friend to miss when i move, couldn’t beleive i didn’t see anyone i knew. got to work a half hour late, high on adrenaline and caffeine, no one even asked what that green band around my neck was or those 3 sets of beads around my neck. went home.. tried to collapse, went out again skateboarding. which in the state of my knees, legs feet and mindset should have been impossible, but those kickflips kept coming out. i found myself screaming at anyone i saw, being totally rash and filled with the fucked up mentality that the show gave me. it hasn’t calmed down, i hope it doesn’t. life’s too short to play it safe, i’m glad i blew off all those important things, spend all my college money, went with someone i barely knew and had alot of fun. summers been so good to me, i’ve been living this song mark told me about, i’ve been doing so many crazy things this summer, i thought the worst was getting into a relationship with a girl i just met and have to leave in two weeks, but this show is quite a close second. i know people are goin to blow off the show as what it eally was, corporate sponsored greed, media driven hype, spring break in the summertime, but screw that, it was fun, it was scary, its something i’m glad i was apart of and something now that i have to get the vdeo for just to see myself again. </span> </p> <p> </p> <p> <span __num="73" __label="true"> good things: </span> </p> <p> <br> <span __num="74" __label="true"> no fights </span> <br> <span __num="75" __label="true"> i don’t think i saw one person get there ass kicked. my theory for this is simple. i could have beat the shit outta someone during a show that ticked me off, but about twenty people would do the same thing to me. kinda a nuclear war, no winners scenario, kept the balance because of fear of the outcome. either that or everyone was too tired to fight or didn’t want to get all stinky after taking that one shower for the week. </span> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.cglbrd.com/entries/2835.html" target="out"> <img

were busted and not in any shape to use, so water got scare or just hard to get to. what was really something they must have looked over was the drainage to all the water that freely flowed outta the pipes. ie, there was none. there was a group of bathrooms on the top of a small hill in the concert area. each day i walked near it, the muddiness of the grass that sat beside it got larger and larger till it covered clear across the whole aircraft field, it was impossible not to get your feet wet and muddy and as such my feet stayed nicely wet for four days, dish pan hands are nothing compared to
