These are all products intended to beused by normal people and thrown up on a corporate network or eventhe Internet. Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but I'ma fairly advanced user myself, and I still expect that my softwaredistributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That'sone of the reasons I don't roll my own distribution. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="118" __label="true"> Of the eight common distributions I could think of, three havenothing whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of theothers didn't seem to be doing anything useful. No wonder Linux has asecurity problem: while those four distributions have probably lessthan a quarter of the Linux market, they tend to be high-profiledistributions which garner more than their share of media coverage. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="119" __label="true"> These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they'redamaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Everytime I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, I have toconsider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can answer.These distributions' total lack of concern with security is anembarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="120" __label="true"> Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reportersthat many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little theaverage user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount oftime to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security,as I am. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work.These people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work todo. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="121" __label="true"> If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systemswouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems havebeen exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a yearold, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a professional,I know that they shouldn't even be running it, because I know thatthey're not using it. But I can't expect them to know, and I can't evenfix it myself: I didn't know that some of these machines existeduntil I found out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users to read asingle, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty goodsolution -- when those lists exist. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="122" __label="true"> Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don'tprovide security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to aWeb site, a mailing list, or both. They should abandon thesedistributions not because they necessarily need the security noticesfor themselves, but because these distributions are ruining Linux'simage not only with novice users, but with the reporters and editors whoshape managers' opinions on whether Linux is a viable solution. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="123" __label="true"> You may claim that you're a hobbyist, and you couldn't care less ifbusinesses use Linux; that's your right, certainly. However, you losenothing when businesses use Linux, you lose nothing when securityupdates are made available and publicized, and you gain nothing whenbusinesses reject Linux because some vendor couldn't be bothered topackage up an already publicly-available solution to a securityhole. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="124" __label="true"> The rest of us do lose. It hurts our professional reputations whenwe stand behind a piece of software with frequent andhighly-publicized security lapses.

Anyone whoattatches a computer or a network to the Internet is placing themselves atrisk. There are malicious people out there who want to steal yourinformation, just like there are malicious people out there who want tosteal your wallet.

Ultimately, your computer's safetyis your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your ownresponsibility. Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the networksecure. They also have security guards and alarm systems and such to keepthe physical premeses physically secured. At home, you have locks on yourdoors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep intruders out of yourhome. I say "help" because the fact remains that if someone really wantsto break into your house, they will, alarm system notwithstanding. Thesame is true for computers on the 'net. If someone *really* wants to getin, they will. There are, however measures that can be taken to make itmuch more difficult. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="334" __label="true"> Yes, there are people out there who are trying to help look out foreverybody's safety, just like there are police patrolling the streetslooking out for everyones safety ... and they're about as effective. Thefact remains that if you don't know how to spot a potential mugger, and ifyou don't bother learning basic personal safety practices (like scanningthe area for potential baddies before unlocking your car door orapproaching your home, or being able to spot the scratches on the lock anddoor frame that indicate forced entry), you're much more likely to getmugged than the person who *has* bothered to learn these things. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="335" __label="true"> Similarly, if you don't bother learning basic computer safetypractices (like editing inetd.conf, and configuring firewalling), you'remuch more likely to get cracked that the person who *has* learned thesethings. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="336" __label="true"> It doesn't take much. Anyone who has any semblance of intelligencehigher that that of an earthworm can figure out how to edit theirinetd.conf file to turn off unecessary daemons. Configuring IPChains is apiece of cake, if you bother to read the FAQ and HOWTO. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="337" __label="true"> I have no sympathy for anyone who whines about how hard it is to setup a Linux/BSD/UNIX system. "But Windows just works" is the party line... primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install. They buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which comewith Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install Windows ondozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how insecure theyare when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go surfing the net. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="338" __label="true"> At least Linux and the other freeware Unices *have* easily accessiblemechanisms like inetd.conf, and firewalling tools like IPChains that allowthem to be made more secure. At least the users of these systems know (orshould know) that there are security issues to be addressed. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="339" __label="true"> Most Windows users are blissfully unaware that they are wide open tomany attacks that can crash their machines, and many more attacks thattake advantage of their ignorance to use email attatchments, JavaScript,ActiveX, and other such methods to install backdoors into their systems. Furthermore, most Windows users have no simple method to block suchattacks against their home box that they use to dial directly into the'net. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="340" __label="true"> When these users load Linux, without taking the time to learn aboutthe issues involved, they remain just as ignorant of their securitysituation as they were when they were running Windows. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="341" __label="true"> People take the time to attend self defense and "street smarts"seminars, and martial arts classes to learn how to protect themselves inthe Real World(tm).

IfI were to set up and configure a Linux desktop for someone, there are a LOTof things I'd be doing to the system AFTER installing the distribution,with security changes being in the lead position, and other things likemanageability being next (for example, cleanup scripts that ensure logsdon't fill up /var). </span> <br> <br> <span __num="417" __label="true"> There are a lot of things a distribution could do to make life HELLfor a system administrator, but making EVERYTHING be defaulted to turnedOFF is not one of them.

As one of several student Unixsysadmins in the computer science department, I have to deal with the sametypes of things he does. One of the reasons we've opted not to go withLinux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is because (1) wefeel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable and secure thanLinux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven environment in which ourCS students can code. This does not prevent many attempts to exploit ourmachines, however. On the average, I spend nearly twenty minutes *perhour* scrounging through logs and checking stats to ensure that my fellowstudents are safe at what they do best (coding).This does not come at an easy price. Since I'm only one of a fewsecurity-minded student sysadmins, I have to make sure that my coworkersare kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories and fixes,etc.[I mean this as no offense to anyone, but I've also noticed that the ircnetwork EFNet seems to split a lot more often now that Linux ircds havepopped up. Things weren't this way when they stuck to *BSD daemons. *sigh*]I simply wish we could all just listen to what Jon Lasser was trying topoint out instead of nitpicking over the details of whether or not aparticular distribution has security lists/pages/whatnot. </span> </p> <p> <small> <a href="/add-comment/reply/4117/"> <span __num="429"> [reply] </span> </a> <a href="#top"> <span __num="430"> [top] </span> </a> </small> </p> <p> </p>

Many peopleare opinionated on which Linux system people should use, as hard as thatis to believe, and tend to take things to the extreme when someone makescomment on it. I guess in a sense I am one of those people as well, butas I have used Red Hat, Debian, OpenBSD, SCO, Solaris, and many other *nixoses, I feel that my decision in a *nix OS is an educated decision.Cheers,The Bugroot@linuxbug.net </span> </p> <p> <small> <a href="/add-comment/reply/4108/"> <span __num="567"> [reply] </span> </a> <a href="#top"> <span __num="568"> [top] </span> </a> </small> </p> <p> </p>

This is in fact not true, and neather is saying"Redhat is the most secure" or Debian or Caldera, or any distrobution orOperating system. Even your linux box in the corner of your office with astatic ip, with just telnet and ftp services running, and all the latestpatches you can think of put on it; is ALOT less secure then if you pullout the ethernet wire. In this day and age there is no "most secured"linux distrobution. There is always something else you can do to make itjust a little more secure. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="706" __label="true"> All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the peoplewho released the distrobution. Which means in fact, that hundreds ofdifferent programs, written by hundreds of different people are on thesame computer. Thos will also mean that there is a very likely chancethat one or more of those programs will have security problems. And I amnot just talking about Linux, or just Unix in general. Look at Windows 9598 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of programmers work on them, fromone major company, and there was a mistake in codeing that caused remoteusers to be able to disconnect them from the internet. Something likethat could happen in the linux world also, a popularly used program thathas a tragic flaw. </span> <br> <br> <span __num="707" __label="true"> Personally though, as many other people have said, when firstinstalling any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up inetd.confdisableing services that arent needed.

Slackware on the other hand uses programs as is and does virtually nomodifications which always seems to get RH in trouble.

You simply want to bedictator, choosing for everybody the good way... </span> <br> <span __num="901" __label="true"> An another point to answer to jwz, if you can't spend half an a hourper day for security issues, security is definitely not a concern for you,sorry. I'm a bit curious, what is your model of security OS ? Windows ? Soyou never had a look on securityfocus (and others). </span> <br> <span __num="902" __label="true"> I can't see how we can have security actually without spend time forit. </span> <br> <span __num="903" __label="true"> The power of linux is in distributions, everyone can find his "good"distribution, so let the people of distributions works, help them, askthem for new features, but don't ban them.
