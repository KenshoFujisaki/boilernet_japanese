      <p> <span __num="8" __label="true"> Approximately three people still haven't read Dan Brown's </span> <i> <span __num="9" __label="true"> TheDa Vinci Code </span> </i> <span __num="10" __label="true"> : </span> <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000840.html"> <span __num="11" __label="true"> Mark Liberman </span> </a> <span __num="12" __label="true"> , </span> <a href="http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/2004/04/1025.php"> <span __num="13" __label="true"> David Lupher </span> </a> <span __num="14" __label="true"> , and reportedly at least one otherperson (as yet unidentified).* </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="15" __label="true"> Regrettably, neither Barbara nor I are ableto claim that the third non-reader is one of us. What can I say byway of excuse for this? I found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about to leave on a trip to Europe. I bought it for the long, long flights that lay ahead of us, without knowing much about it except that it was supposed to be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuffand the blurbs said it was great. I didn't open it, I just grabbed oneoff a pallet of about 500 copies.Barbara was between mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from meand rapidly read it over the next couple of daysbefore we even left for the airport. I asked hopefully what it was like. She scowled and said something about the Hardy Boys.My heart sank; I understood her to mean it was pathetic butpossibly of interest to the 11-year-old market. By the time we wereon our plane she had made sure thather flight bag contained a new novel by </span> <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000795.html"> <span __num="16" __label="true"> Menking Hannell </span> </a> <span __num="17" __label="true"> , and over southern Oregon she told me it was great asusual. Unfortunately I had no better idea of what to do with my time,so I opened </span> <i> <span __num="18" __label="true"> The Da Vinci Code </span> </i> <span __num="19" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="20" __label="true"> I am still trying to come up with a fully convincing account of justwhat it was about his very first sentence, indeed the very first word,that told me instantly that I was in for a very bad time stylistically. </span> </p> 
      <a name="more"> </a> 
      <p> <i> <span __num="21" __label="true"> The Da Vinci Code </span> </i> <span __num="22" __label="true"> may well be the only novel ever writtenthat begins with the word </span> <i> <span __num="23" __label="true"> renowned </span> </i> <span __num="24" __label="true"> . Here is the paragraphwith which the book opens. The scene (says a dateline under thechapter heading, 'Prologue') is the Louvre, late at night: </span> </p> 
      <blockquote> 
       <p> <font color="red"> <span __num="25" __label="true"> Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-oldman heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas. </span> </font> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <p> <span __num="26" __label="true"> I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to spenda number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in thehistory of literature was this. Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalisticstories about deaths; you just don't do it in describing an event in a narrative. So this might be reasonabletext for the opening of a newspaper report the next day: </span> </p> 
      <blockquote> 
       <p> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Renowned curator Jacques Saunière died last night in the Louvreat the age of 76. </span> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <p> <span __num="28" __label="true"> But Brown packs such details into the first two words of an </span> <b> <span __num="29" __label="true"> action </span> </b> <span __num="30" __label="true"> sequence — details of not only his protagonist's profession but also his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here.It has the ring of utter ineptitude. The details have no relevance, of course, to what is being narrated (Saunière isfleeing an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarmsystem and the security gates). We could have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact that he wascurating at the Louvre. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="31" __label="true"> The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and wordchoice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line). Look at the phrase "the seventy-six-year-old man".It's a complete let-down: we knew he was a man — the anaphoric pronoun "he" had just been used to refer to him. (This is perhaps where "curator" could have been slipped in for thefirst time, without "renowned", if the passage were rewritten.)Look at "heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas." We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of credentials, for heaven's sake). Surely "toward him" feels better than "toward himself" (though I guess both are grammatical here). Surely "tore from the wall" shouldbe "tore away from the wall". Surely a single man can't fall into aheap (there's only him, that's not a heap). And why repeat the name"Saunière" here instead of the pronoun "he"? Who else is around? (Caravaggio hasn't been mentioned; "aCaravaggio" uses the name as an attributive modifier with conventionallyelided head noun "painting". That isn't a mention of the man.) </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Well, actually, there </span> <b> <span __num="33" __label="true"> is </span> </b> <span __num="34" __label="true"> someone else around, but we only learn thatthree paragraphs down, after "a thundering iron gate" has fallen (by theway, it's the fall that makes a thundering noise: there's no such thingas a thundering gate)."The curator" (his profession is now named a second time in case you missed it) "...crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous spacefor someplace to hide" (the colloquial American "someplace" seems very odd here as compared with standard "somewhere"). Then: </span> </p> 
      <blockquote> 
       <p> <font color="red"> <span __num="35" __label="true"> A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move." </span> </font> </p> 
       <font color="red"> <p> <span __num="36" __label="true"> On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly. </span> </p> </font> 
       <p> <font color="red"> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars. He was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His irises were pink with dark red pupils. </span> </font> </p> 
      </blockquote> 
      <p> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Just count the infelicities here.A voice doesn't speak —a person speaks; a voice is what a person speaks </span> <b> <span __num="39" __label="true"> with </span> </b> <span __num="40" __label="true"> ."Chillingly close" would be right in your ear, whereas this voice is fifteen feet away behind the thundering gate. The curator (do we really need to betold his profession a </span> <b> <span __num="41" __label="true"> third </span> </b> <span __num="42" __label="true"> time?) cannot slowly turn his head if hehas frozen; freezing (as a voluntary human action) means temporarilyceasing all muscular movements. And crucially, a silhouettedoes not stare! A silhouette is a shadow. If Saunière can see the man'spale skin, thinning hair, iris color, and red pupils (all at fifteen feet),the man cannot possibly be in silhouette. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily,thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared withalternatives. I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill, andit never gets much better. Why did I keep reading? Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International, and airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood drivel on a smallscreen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal, that's why.And why did I keep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrowtrash bin? Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessonsin how not to write. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> I don't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time novelist, it would seem a cruel blow to a budding career. But Dan Brown is all over the best-seller lists now. In paperback and hardback, and in manylanguages, he is a phenomenon. He is up there with the Stephen Kingsand the John Grishams and nothing I say can conceivably harm him. He isa huge, blockbuster, worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants andneed never work again. And he writes like the kind of freshman student who makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching. Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and puzzle clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible, terrible example of the thriller-writer's craft. </span> </p> 
      <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> Which brings us to the question of the blurbs. "Dan Brown has to be one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in thecountry," said Nelson DeMille, a bestselling author who has himselfhit the #1 spot in the </span> <i> <span __num="46" __label="true"> New York Times </span> </i> <span __num="47" __label="true"> list. Unbelievablemendacity.And there are four other similar pieces of praise on the back cover.Together those blurbs convinced me to put this piece of garbageon the CostCo cartalong with the the 72-pack of toiletrolls. Thriller writers must have a code of honor that requiresthat they all praise each other's new novels, a kind of </span> <i> <span __num="48" __label="true"> omerta </span> </i> <span __num="49" __label="true"> that enjoins them to silence about the fact that some fellow memberof the guild has given evidence oftotal stylistic cluelessness. A fraternal code of silence. We couldcall it... the Da Vinci code; or the Dan Brown code. </span> </p>
