            <p> <span __num="91" __label="true"> I'm going to be 40, not someday anymore but on a very certain day. My next birthday. Next February to be more specific. And since Oprah has now made 50 the new 40, who really cares about the real 40 anymore. My recently turned 40 friends have all welcomed it the same gusto they turned 21 - and with more booze since they can now afford it. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="92" __label="true"> But I feel the need to do a little something different.

What am I, Who am I, What do I believe? I don't know so much... These are all questions I hope to answer in the next several months. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="95" __label="true"> Clearly Mr. Peters is the mack-daddy of manifesto writing and he is clearly an inspiration to me. I've crushed on him since I wrote my first Excellence paper back in the 80s. He's been a unknowing career counselor to me on my very wacky and strange journey from finance to service to IT to marketing. So now I'm going to take a tip from him on the personal side and put it all on paper for the world to see.&nbsp; If I can come up with something that is 1/10 as intense and as filled with truth I will consider myself successful. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="96" __label="true"> I will write my manifesto - and I will actually show it to people. Something a bit geeky unexpected but what the hell. The Dr. will find it truly embarrassing, he prefers I keep my geeky and unexpected tendencies behind closed doors or better yet, only on the Internet and not in his actual reality - but he will survive. It will be my birthday present to myself. </span> </p>

It's not my ideal house, I've always dreamed of the classic colonial but when we found this one there was so much else that was right - that I quietly but willingly kissed my dreams of brick and columns and banistered staircases goodbye. I felt a vibe from this house from the beginning despite the fact that our realtor was sure I'd hate it. And there was a lot to hate - the whole dame interior was PINK. This blog is the exact shade of pink that my entire house was. But I got a vibe. This house knew me, and I knew it. I got a vibe. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="107" __label="true"> What we didn't know is that we were getting the perfect street as well. And so many new and wonderful friends. And roots. We'd moved so many times that we'd stopped thinking about roots. We'd lived in this same town for 3 years now and maybe we knew 5 more people than when we first got her. We didn't bother putting down roots because we expected to move again. But we stayed in town and started putting down roots. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="108" __label="true"> And what I realize now that it's gentle work creating roots. You do it with great care. And on some level I think I was afraid to blog about the connections and friendships I was making. They were new and fragile and beautiful and they had to be protected. It was such new territory for me making real, actual people you see everyday type friends. I didn't want to mess it up. I was being protective of them. They are not computer geeks, they do not blog, the have not presented themselves to the internet for inspection. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="109" __label="true"> The ladies are also stay at home moms. And that scared me. My experiences with stay at home moms hadn't been that positive in the past. In general they didn't seem to want to let the working mom's be a part of their club. So I was a little shy on that front as well but really wanting everything to work out. Blogging about it didn't seem like the best way to bridge the gap. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="110" __label="true"> Then there was the fact that I was learning be the mother of more than one child and learning how to manage and juggle and make sure that both children felt their mother was meeting their needs. Blogging about P but not S, or S but not P, made me feel guilty. What if they wasn't something I wanted to say about both of them on any given day? </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="111" __label="true"> So with all this goodness and fun happening all around only the bad stuff was making it into the blog. I was ranting, and venting, and pissing, and moaning. And I hated it. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="112" __label="true"> Now that I feel like I've got a handle on what went wrong I think I can steer myself towards things that 1) excite me enough to write about 2) still fit in the comfort zone of what I feel I can write about. I've ordered </span> <a href="http://www.mightygirl.net/shop"> <span __num="113" __label="true"> this book </span> </a> <span __num="114" __label="true"> to help me with ideas as well. And I feel like I'm on track, I have a plan, I'm moving forward.... </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="115" __label="true"> So, do you want to know what I had for lunch today? </span> </p>

My stinking Comcast DVR cut off the last few seconds of the show and all I saw was steam... and some dude. I was flipping out! Who was in that bathroom?!? Thank God </span> <a href="http://www.greyswriters.com/"> <span __num="124" __label="true"> Grey Matter </span> </a> <span __num="125" __label="true"> was able to clear it up pretty quickly. But nothing beats actually seeing the scene play out... and seeing the look on Derek's face. If your DVR cut it off, go watch the end on ABC! Quickly! </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="126" __label="true"> I love Merideth's decision to not decide! That just means more McDreamy and more McVet for me! Yeah!!! </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> The Izzie thing is a little hard to swallow even with "willing suspension of disbelief" - I mean you just don't get to stay in a residency program after you kill a patient sort of on purpose like that no matter what. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="128" __label="true"> I loved Alex in the bar scene - I feel like the old Alex is back. </span> </p>

First of all she's a tough chick Ortho - which well, just ROCKS! But to me she' always represented that 95% of the population who aren't in the cool, popular kids club. She's the girl on the outside that face it, most of us were (are). She looking in and wanting to be a part, wanting to be liked, and not sure how to make them see that she's cool too if they'd only give her a chance. Callie is the most real character, she's what they try to make George into but somehow just fall a little short by making him more wimpy than insecure. I love Callie, I have a mad girl crush on Callie. </span> </p>

            <p> <span __num="151" __label="true"> Seems the Fifths Disease that Stinkerbell so lovely brought home three-weeks ago is a little more hard to handle when the adults of the house get it.

            <p> <span __num="152" __label="true"> I thought I was going to avoid it but it took the form of a chest cold and an inflamed liver. Yes, an inflamed liver.

            <p> <span __num="153" __label="true"> Evidently you can get a form of that without a stylish A B or C to accessorize it. It's just plain jane and resolves on it's own. But in the meantime the white coats like to prod you a lot and drain you alot just to see what's what with the enzymes. </span> </p>

So to have like sounding nicknames on top of that just didn't work out. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="164" __label="true"> So SugarPop became Stinkerbell (or StinkerPuss if I want to make Puddin' all crazy).

            <p> <span __num="173" __label="true"> Well I am back again. I disabled this blog for a while because I sort of felt like I didn't know what I wanted to say anymore. As with most experiments it started out as one thing but grew into a different thing and I didn't really like where it was going. I hoped by shutting it down I'd find a new direction to go. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="174" __label="true"> But a few days ago I stumbled along a forgotten link, quite by accident - it was in my "one day I should take the time to read these blogs" folder and an inadvertant mouse click introduced me to </span> <a href="http://www.misszoot.com/index.php"> <span __num="175" __label="true"> Miss Zoot </span> </a> <span __num="176" __label="true"> . The right place and the right time... and she reminded me of all the reasons that I wanted to blog in the first place. She clearly was having the fun that I had long ago hoped to find and made me think that it was still out there just waiting for another try. </span> </p> 
            <p> <span __num="177" __label="true"> So I re-visited my own blog and found that if I just scrubbed 2006 I didn't hate me quite so much so that's what I did. I ditched all my snarky posts from this year and we're open for business again. The truth is it's been a really good year and I'll write a couple of posts that catch up anyone who still happens to wander by.. bless you for keeping the faith. </span> </p>
