He and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko were the first two-person crew to live board the Station following the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in February 2003. The crew flew to and returned from the Station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. </span> </em> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <br> <strong> <span __num="4" __label="true"> On riding the Soyuz spacecraft </span> </strong> <span __num="5"> : </span> <br> <span __num="6" __label="true"> “I had the pleasure to fly twice on the Shuttle, and I can tell you the experience in Russia is very different,” Lu said. “When you’re launching on the Shuttle, it shakes a lot. It’s like driving over a dirt road at 40 to 50 miles per hour.” The vibrations are caused by the Shuttle’s Solid Rocket Boosters. Since the Soyuz rocket relies entirely on liquid-fuel engines, it’s a much smoother ride. However, the Soyuz is a three-stage rocket, and there’s a strong acceleration when the stages separate, particularly the last one. “When that thing went, if felt like we’d been kicked in the butt by a giant.” Another difference was that he and Malenchenko were not allowed to carry as much with them on the Soyuz for their 6-month stay. Landing was also very different. For example, the Soyuz uses an ablative heat shield, which means it burns up as the craft re-enters the atmosphere. “I remember looking out the window watching pieces of our ship burn off, which is normal, but it’s still a little bit disconcerting,” he said. The Soyuz also uses a parachute attached to the side of the spacecraft. When it opens, the crew is hanging sidewise, spinning in a circle. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong> <span __num="7" __label="true"> On the International Space Station </span> </strong> <span __num="8" __label="true"> : </span> <br> <span __num="9" __label="true"> “The Space Station is like a big tube now,” Lu said. “It’s about the size of a large jetliner.” As the Soyuz approached the Station, he said it “looked like a small model. It really feels like you’re in a science fiction movie.” With the smaller crew and fewer supplies coming up from Earth, keeping equipment operational was an important part of the crew’s duties. “We spent a lot of time working on equipment,” he said. “Another thing we spent a lot of time doing was exercise.” The exercise paid off—Lu was one of the first American astronauts to return from a long-duraction spaceflight with almost no loss in bone density and little loss in muscle strength. The crew was given an “exercise prescription” for the work-out they had to perform. “And, I did extra on top of that on my own,” Lu said. “I came back with less bone loss than anyone.” His experience will help astronauts healthy when they begin making the long trips to other worlds. “When we do fly to Mars or asteroids or far away locations, it will take months,” he said. “It could even take years.” Lu said he enjoyed his stay on the Station. “It was a blast from start to finish. Towards the ending I was wishing it would last a little longer. I wasn’t ready to come home yet.” </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong> <img align="right" alt="Ed Lu" height="288" hspace="5" src="images/lu3.jpg" vspace="5" width="233"> <span __num="10" __label="true"> On eating aboard the Space Station </span> </strong> <span __num="11"> : </span> <br> <span __num="12" __label="true"> “The food up there is pretty good, actually,” Lu said. However, while the food is tasty, it gets monotonous after a while, much like eating at your favorite restaurant every night would be. “For us, it’s 3 months before we get to eat somewhere else.” That’s why the crew looks forward to the arrival of the Progress cargo ship, carrying supplies from Earth. “It is a welcome thing, because it brings fresh food.” Another welcome delivery of the Progress is odors. “Space Station has no smell whatsoever,” Lu said, explaining that, because of the air circulation system, when you open a can of food, you can smell it only for seconds before the odor is circulated away. When the Progress docked, however, the astronauts could smell food inside. “When you opened the valve up, before you actually open the hatch, you could smell apples in the Space Station,” he said. “We were looking at our watches (until it was time to open the hatch). Those things tasted terrific.” </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong> <span __num="13" __label="true"> On playing the piano upside down in microgravity </span> </strong> <span __num="14" __label="true"> : </span> <br> <span __num="15" __label="true"> You can’t do it. When you’re upside down, “everything’s reversed,” Lu explained. “If you ever try it, it’s not as easy as it looks.” </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong> <span __num="16" __label="true"> On the view from the Space Station </span> </strong> <span __num="17"> : </span> <br> <span __num="18" __label="true"> “With binoculars, you can see airplanes in flight,” he said. “You can see individual buildings.

Ordinarily, it is difficult to see celestial objects from the Station while the lights are on, since the crew’s eyes are adjusted for the brighter conditions. “Mars was bright enough last summer that it was always out the window,” he said, explaining that it was visible even with the lights on. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong> <span __num="20" __label="true"> On being on a two-person crew with Malenchenko </span> </strong> <span __num="21"> : </span> <br> <span __num="22" __label="true"> “I learned to like, believe it or not, Russian rap music,” he said. “We got along great. We never had a single argument. We think a lot a like.” He said that he and Malenchenko were fortunate that they had similar philosophies about the mission, and that they each worked to be a good crewmate. </span> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Biographical Data </span> </strong> <br> <strong> <span __num="24" __label="true"> Hometown </span> </strong> <span __num="25" __label="true"> : Honolulu, Hawaii, and Webster, New York </span> <br> <strong> <span __num="26" __label="true"> Born </span> </strong> <span __num="27" __label="true"> : July 1, 1963 </span> <br> <strong> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Education </span> </strong> <span __num="29" __label="true"> : Graduated from R.L.
