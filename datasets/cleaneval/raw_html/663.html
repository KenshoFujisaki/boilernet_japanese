Only a few standing lights were still burning and the door to the bedroom was securely shut. Suddenly his eyes popped open and he got to his feet. A moment later the lift door opened for Qui-Gon, still accompanied by Obi-Wan and Jacen. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="20" __label="true"> "Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs."

"I know." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Obi-Wan picked up the small security monitor lying on a table, frowned at the blank screen." "What's this?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="29" __label="true"> "She wouldn't let me put any cameras in her room." Anakin explained, adding apologetically. "I don't think she liked the idea of me watching her." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="30" __label="true"> "What is she thinking?" Obi-Wan looked towards the bedroom door as if tempted to shake the Queen awake and demand an explanation. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="31" __label="true"> "Artoo is in there with her," Anakin assured Qui-Gon, "set on surveillance mode. He'll pick up an intruder as quickly as the cameras would." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> "I'm not worried about intruders." Obi-Wan snapped. "Professional assassins have ways of killing from a distance that not even Artoo could detect." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="33" __label="true"> "I know but we want to catch this assassin, don't we, Master?" Anakin countered, still addressing Qui-Gon. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="34" __label="true"> "You're using her as bait." Obi-Wan sounded incredulous as well as angry. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="35" __label="true"> "It was her idea." Anakin retorted defensively. Turned back to Qui-Gon. "Don't worry, no harm will come to her. I'm aware of everything going on in that room." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="36" __label="true"> "It's too risky." said Obi-Wan, also to Qui-Gon, then to Anakin. "Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, young Padawan." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="37" __label="true"> "And yours are?" Anakin challenged, temper fraying. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Obi-Wan's look was sternly quelling. "Possibly." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="39" __label="true"> "Obi-Wan is older and more experienced." the Master cut in quietly. "And you are letting emotion cloud your mind, Anakin. Let go of fear and feel the Living Force." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="40" __label="true"> His Padawn bit his lip. "I'll try, Master." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="41" __label="true"> "Do or do not, there is no try." Jacen quoted in a rather good imitation of Yoda's voice. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan grinned and the tension between them eased. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="42" __label="true"> "Stay with us, Obi-Wan." Qui-Gon continued. "It may be we'll solve your problem as well as our own tonight." ****************************************** </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="43" __label="true"> Hours passed. The Master occupied one couch, radiating peace as he meditated, Jacen the other, openly dozing. Obi-Wan and Anakin stood near the bedroom door talking in undertones. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="44" __label="true"> "Master risked his own future with the Order to see you trained," Obi-Wan was saying with quiet intensity, "will you throw that gift back in his face?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="45" __label="true"> "Of course not!" Anakin hissed back. "I'd never do that to him." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="46" __label="true"> "Then *think* about what you are doing, Anakin!" the young Master retorted. "If you continue to follow your impulses you could hurt a lot of people," nodded towards the bedroom, "including her!" his voice softened. "Not to mention yourself." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="47" __label="true"> "I've thought about her and dreamed about her every day for the last ten years." Anakin admitted painfully. Took a breath. "You're right, Padme's an attachment, like my Mother, and like Mom I've got to let her go." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Obi-Wan put a consoling hand on his shoulder. Suddenly both their heads swivled towards the door. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="49" __label="true"> "Obi-Wan!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="50" __label="true"> "I feel it also." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Sabres drawn they sprinted into the Queen's Bedroom </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Amidala woke with a shock. She had a split second glimpse of segmented, multi-legged *somethings* before they vanished in a flash of green light. Saw Anakin standing over her on the bed, sabre blazing in his hand, and Obi-Wan go through the window with a crash of glass and clash of blinds. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="53" __label="true"> "Idiot!" Anakin doused his sabre and ran out past Master Qui-Gon. The other Padawan started to follow but the Master called him back. "No, Jacen, I need you here." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="54" __label="true"> Eirtae and Rabe hurtled into the room, flinging themselves down beside her. "Your Highness, are you all right?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Amidala managed a nod, her voice wasn't working yet. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="56" __label="true"> Typho was right behind them with a pair of guards. "What happened?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="57" __label="true"> "The Queen is safe." Qui-Gon told him but she musn't stay here." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="58" __label="true"> "She can come down to my rooms." Jamillia spoke breathlessly from the doorway, a robe clutched around her and a handmaiden at her back. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="59" __label="true"> "An excellent idea, Senator. Your Highness?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="60" __label="true"> "Yes, yes of course." Amidala said shakily. She got out of bed, Rabe quickly draped a dressing gown over her. She started for the door, Eirtae's arm around her. Paused to look at the broken window and then at the Master. "Obi-Wan, Anakin...?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="61" __label="true"> "They'll be all right." he reassured her. Eyebrows quirked ruefully. "I'm afraid both my past and present Padawans are somewhat reckless." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Amidala scraped up a smile. "I wonder where they could have learned it from?" and his eyes crinkled in answering amusement. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="63" __label="true"> "Come on, Ammi," Jamillia said taking her arm, "it'll be just like at school. Remember how we used to sneak into each others rooms after hours?" they headed for the lift, the other four women clustered tightly around her, and nearly collided with Jar Jar followed by a pair of armed Gungans. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="64" __label="true"> "Padme! Yousa not hurtin?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="65" __label="true"> "I'm fine, General Binks, don't worry." then they were in the lift, the doors closing behind them, as Jar Jar demanded; "Captain Typho, whatsa goin' on herin?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> </font> </small> </p> <p> <strong> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="66" __label="true"> Part VI </span> </font> </small> </strong> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="67" __label="true"> Anakin wove frantically through the nightime traffic high above the rooftops of Coruscant. Flashes of blaster fire some distance away caught his eye. "That's gotta be him." he decked the accelerator but by the time he got to the scene there was no blaster fire, no assassin droid, just a spread-eagled human body falling towards the brightly lighted canyons thousands of feet below. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="68" __label="true"> Anakin dove steeply, pulled up and Obi-Wan landed on the speeder's stern as neatly as one could please. He clambered breathlessly into the passenger seat. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="69" __label="true"> "Master Kenobi, fancy meeting you here." Anakin greeted mockingly </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="70" __label="true"> "What took you so long?" the other snapped. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="71" __label="true"> "You know me, Obi-Wan, I had to find a speeder I really liked; mach 10 engines, open cockpit, totally cool paint job -" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="72" __label="true"> "I am underwelmed by your wit, Padawan." the Master's voice dripped icicles, "Where's Jacen?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="73" __label="true"> "Back with our Master I guess, he didn't catch up with me in time." As they spoke Anakin spotted a sleek closed speeder leaving with suspicious speed and gave chase. "That him?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="74" __label="true"> Obi-Wan's face went blank a moment as he searched the Force. "Yes!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="75" __label="true"> "Riiight!" Anakin hit the accelerator again. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="76" __label="true"> Sensing he was being followed the assassin wove confusingly through traffic lanes, between buildings and through the interlaced beams of a half-finished skyscraper. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="77" __label="true"> Obi-Wan clung white knuckled to the side of the speeder. "Careful! Hey, easy!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="78" __label="true"> "Sorry, Master, I forgot you don't like flying." The speeder dropped a few feet, just enough to miss an oncoming transport. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="79" __label="true"> "I don't like flying with *you*!" Obi-Wan retorted. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="80" __label="true"> Anakin looked over at him. "Obi-Wan, you know I've been flying since before I could walk I'm very good -" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="81" __label="true"> "Watch where you're going!" an oncoming stream of private speeders split to avoid them. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="82" __label="true"> Anakin dropped out of the lane. "Sorry about that." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="83" __label="true"> Obi-Wan closed his eyes, inhaled a calming breath. "Just slow down." he said in carefully measured tones. Opened his eyes, pointed. "There! There he goes." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="84" __label="true"> The assassin's speeder ducked behind a line of freight transports. Anakin went under them, gaining steadily as the two vehicled banked right turns around tower spires and neon billboards. Attempting to elude his pursuer the assassin ducked into a tram tunnel. Anakin promptly followed. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="85" __label="true"> "Wait! Don't go in there!" Obi-Wan gasped as the tunnel closed around them. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="86" __label="true"> "Don't worry, Master, I know what I'm doing." Anakin assured him. They skimmed round a bend and right into their prey, accelerating frantically towards them with a tram filling the tunnel behind. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="87" __label="true"> Anakin flipped the speeder upside down in a tight loop-over and raced out of the tunnel barely ahead of speeder and commuter tram. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="88" __label="true"> Beyond speech Obi-Wan gave his companion a withering look. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="89" __label="true"> "Okay, that was a mistake." Anakin conceeded. The Assassin's speeder pulled along side, a blaster barrel protruded from a side window, Obi-Wan ducked just in time. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="90" __label="true"> "Oops!" Anakin hit the brakes, dropping behind and under their attacker, safe from blaster fire. The assassin dove steeply downward, skimmed low over the flat roofs of a continent sized industrial complex, forcing Anakin to fall behind again. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="91" __label="true"> "Right. This isn't working." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="92" __label="true"> "No kidding." Obi-Wan said acidly. Their prey pulled further ahead, shooting through a quasi-tunnel of giant energy couplings topping a power plant. "Anakin! don't go through there!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="93" __label="true"> Ignoring him the younger Jedi accelerated right after the assassin, under and through the gigantic arcs of blue lightening leaping from coupling to coupling. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="94" __label="true"> "How many times have I told you, stay away from power couplings!" Obi-Wan complained as they shot free. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="95" __label="true"> Anakin grinned. "Yeah, but don't you just love that powerfield tingle?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="96" __label="true"> "No actually." Obi-Wan scanned the skies. "There he goes!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="97" __label="true"> "This is getting old." Anakin muttered as they darted upward in pursuit. "We gotta get ahead of him somehow." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="98" __label="true"> The assassin's speeder veered sharply, diving into a brilliantly lighted throughway for air traffic piercing a dense range of multi-spired towers. Anakin banked the other way looping around the buildings. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="99" __label="true"> "What are you doing? you're going the wrong way." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="100" __label="true"> Ani shook his head, eyes unfocused. "No I'm not. This is a shortcut." blinked. "I think." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="101" __label="true"> "You *think*?" Obi-Wan echoed, incredulously. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="102" __label="true"> They hovered above the stream of traffic emerging from the throughway for long seconds. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="103" __label="true"> Obi-Wan, grimly. "You've lost him." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="104" __label="true"> Anakin, calmly. "No I haven't." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="105" __label="true"> Obi-Wan begining to lose his temper. "He went completely the other way!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="106" __label="true"> Anakin, even more calmly. "We'll see." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="107" __label="true"> Obi-Wan breathed, regaining his composure. "Anakin, we've lost him. We should -" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="108" __label="true"> "Excuse me, Master." Anakin said politely and vaulted over the side of the speeder - falling some five stories to land right on top of the assassin's speeder cruising beneath them. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="109" __label="true"> Looking after him Obi-Wan shook his head, muttered. "I hate it when he does that." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> </font> </small> </p> <p> <strong> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="110" __label="true"> Part VII </span> </font> </small> </strong> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="111" __label="true"> Anakin clawed for a handhold on the sleek surface of the speeder as the wind tore at him. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="112" __label="true"> *Okay, maybe this wasn't such a brilliant idea.* </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="113" __label="true"> He worked his way painfully forward to the transparent canopy, looked in. For an instant it was a woman's face looking back at him with big dark eyes then abruptly, without warning, it shifted to something grey skinned and quite inhuman. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="114" __label="true"> *A Changeling!* </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="115" __label="true"> The assassin, whatever she or it was, braked suddenly and Anakin nearly went flying, barely catching himself on the left prong of the forked front, dangling by his hands. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="116" __label="true"> *Calm, remember calm." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="117" __label="true"> He managed to swing over to the right prong and then work his way up on top again. The assassin, back in Human form, glared at him through the canopy as he ignited his sabre to cut his way in. Grabbed the blaster lying on the seat next to her and fired up at him. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="118" __label="true"> Anakin just managed to block the bolt, not easy at such close quarters, but the impact knocked the sabre from his hand. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="119" __label="true"> *Oh no, not again!* </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="120" __label="true"> He shoved his hand through the hole in the canopy, grabbing the assassin's wrist as she tried for a second shot. It went wild, striking the control board and the speeder began to lose altitude, bucking wildly. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="121" __label="true"> Anakin hung on as the assassin fought for control but the impact as they hit the pavement of a pedestrian way sent him flying into a row of fuel drums. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="122" __label="true"> Picking himself up he looked around. Not one of Coruscant's more salubrious districts, a varigated crowd of panhandling undersiders, criminals, con-artists and slumming glitterati were lit by garish neon signs as they wandered along an esplanade of gritty entertainment clubs. A few glanced at Anakin but quickly looked away, not wanting to get involved. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="123" __label="true"> He pushed through the crowd to the crashed speeder, saw the assassin climb out and gave chase, pushing and shoving people out of his way. His quarry darted through the door of one of the clubs and Anakin was about to follow when a hand fell on his arm stopping him in his tracks. He started to throw it off then realized it was Obi-Wan. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="124" __label="true"> "She went in there!" he panted. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="125" __label="true"> "Patience." Obi-Wan answered, annoyingly unruffled. "Use the Force, Anakin, think. He went in there to hide, not run." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="126" __label="true"> And even more annoyingly right, as usual. "Yes, Obi-Wan." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="127" __label="true"> The older Jedi offered him his sabre. "I believe this is yours?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="128" __label="true"> "Yeah, thanks." Anakin tried to take it but Obi-Wan refused to let go of his end. *Uh-oh, stand by for lecture.* </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="129" __label="true"> "A Jedi's sabre is his most precious possession. He must keep it with him at all times." Obi-Wan scolded, transfixing him with those blue eyes. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Anakin restrained an urge to roll his own. "Yes, Master." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="131" __label="true"> "This weapon is your *life*!" the Master emphasized. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="132" __label="true"> "I know, I'm sorry." Obi-Wan did have a point after all. "It was an accident." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="133" __label="true"> "Jedi don't have 'accident', Anakin. You must be more focused." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="134" __label="true"> "I know, I know. Look could we have the rest of the lesson later, we've got an assassin to catch." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="135" __label="true"> Shaking his head Obi-Wan let go of his end of the lightsabre and led the way into the club. "How does our Master put up with you?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="136" __label="true"> "He practiced on the Padawan he had before me." Anakin returned saucily. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="137" __label="true"> His predecessor grinned wryly. "He did indeed, poor Master, he always picks the difficult ones." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="138" __label="true"> Anakin nodded agreement. Still, if he could manage to turn out even half as well as Obi-Wan had..... </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="139" __label="true"> It seemed to be some kind of sports bar. Giant screens lined the walls showing various games and contests - including pod-racing! Anakin tore his eyes away and reminded himself to focus. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="140" __label="true"> "Do you see him?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="141" __label="true"> He scanned the crowd watching the screens, drinking, laying bets or just talking sports talk. "No. But Obi-Wan, I think he's a she and that she's a changeling." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="142" __label="true"> Blond eyebrows lifted. "In that case be extra careful." Obi-Wan nodded towards the crowd. "Go and find her." </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="143" __label="true"> Anakin blinked. "Me? What about you?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="144" __label="true"> "I," Obi-Wan replied coolly, "am going to get a drink." quirked an eyebrow at him. "Possibly more than one." and with that he headed purposefully towards the bar leaving Anakin gaping after him. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="145" __label="true"> *What happened to his focus?* he wondered. The chase must have been harder on Obi-Wan's nerves than he, Anakin, had realized. *I shouldn't tease him.* But flying was the only thing he did better than Obi-Wan and the temptation to show off was nearly irresistable. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="146" __label="true"> Anakin circled the room, studying the polyglot patrons giving especial attention to the females, both Human and Alien. And they eyed him in return with an appreciation and invitation he'd only recently learned to recognize. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="147" __label="true"> *I wish Padme would look at me like that.* suddenly a familiar hum and flash of blue light spun him towards the bar. Pushing his way against the backwash of patrons he broke through into the empty space that had formed around Obi-Wan standing, sabre ignited, over a grey suited figure clutching at her arm. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="148" __label="true"> *I shoulda known.* Anakin added aloud. "I can't take you anywhere, can I?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="149" __label="true"> Obi-Wan just flicked him a glance, extinguished his sabre and reached down to pull the assassin to her feet. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="150" __label="true"> "Jedi business." Anakin announced to the staring crowd. "Go back to your drinks." and the patrons turned uneasily away, self consciously resuming their activities as the two Jedi half carried their prisoner out a side door into a noisome alley. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="151" __label="true"> "Do you know who you were trying to kill?" Obi-Wan asked, almost conversationally, as he examined the damaged arm. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="152" __label="true"> "The senator from Naboo." the woman mumbled. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="153" __label="true"> "Who hired you?" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="154" __label="true"> "It was just a job." she evaded. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="155" __label="true"> Anakin wasn't having any of that. "Who hired you?" he repeated, added with a touch of Force behind his voice. "Tell us!" </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="156" __label="true"> "It was a bounty hunter," she muttered unwillingly, "called -" broke off with a little gasp. Her eyes glazed, then closed, and as Obi-Wan lowered her to the ground she changed, becoming the wrinkled grey non-Human Anakin had glimpsed in the speeder. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="157" __label="true"> Instinctively the two Jedi glanced over their shoulders, just in time to see an armoured form rocket away from a nearby rooftop. </span> </font> </small> </p> <p> <small> <font face="Arial"> <span __num="158" __label="true"> They looked at each other then Obi-Wan felt at the dead alien's neck, extracting a wicked looking multi-tipped dart.
