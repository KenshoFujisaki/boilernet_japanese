    <p align="center"> <i> <span __num="2" __label="true"> Regular exercise provides a myriad of health benefits for senior adults including a stronger heart, a positive mental outlook and an increased chance of remaining indefinitely independent </span> </i> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="3" __label="true"> "Use it or lose it." </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="4" __label="true"> That's what doctors these days are telling senior citizens about their bodies. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="5" __label="true"> But seniors needn't think they have to sign up for high-impact aerobics classes or run 10K races tostay in shape. Instead, fitting a simple 35-minute walk into their daily activities can keep themphysically strong and agile. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="6" __label="true"> "Walking is a tremendously good activity for senior citizens. It's cheap, it's simple, almostanybody can do it and it Walking has a multitude of health benefits for everyone. It helps seniors has very real benefits for maintain mobility and independence. Older adults," said Dr. Michael Pratt, the acting chief for the PhysicalActivity and Health Branch in the Division ofNutrition and Physical Activity at the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (CDC). </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="7" __label="true"> Dr. Pratt, is a member of the "Partnership for aWalkable America" -- a coalition of private, state andfederal organizations united with the common causeof increasing public awareness about the benefits ofwalking. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="8" __label="true"> Regular exercise is a must for older adults if they want to maintain mobility and independence, Dr.Pratt said. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="9" __label="true"> "Statistics show that most older adults aren't getting enough activity and we know that they standto benefit from regular exercise," he said. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="10" __label="true"> In fact, Americans in general don't get enough exercise, Dr. Pratt said. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="11" __label="true"> According to the Report to the Surgeon General on Physical Activity and Health issued by theCDC in July 1996, sixty percent of Americans are not regularly active and 25 percent areessentially sedentary. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <b> <span __num="12" __label="true"> Sedentary Life Can Be Deadly </span> </b> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="13" __label="true"> New studies are showing that sedentary lifestyles can result in muscle loss and significantlylowered aerobic capacity. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="14" __label="true"> Researchers at the Department of Physical Education at San Diego State University recentlycompleted a 23-year study involving two groups of middle-age men. One group exercisedregularly for 23 years. The other exercised approximately five years and then stopped. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="15" __label="true"> When researchers tested the fitness of the men at the end of the study, they found those whohadn't exercised had lost 41 percent of their maximal aerobic power while those who exercisedlost just 13 percent. These results were interesting since decreased aerobic power has long beenthought to be a natural product of aging. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="16" __label="true"> Additionally, the researchers found that none of the men in the exercise group developed highblood pressure, although two men in this group had high blood pressure initially. In contrast, 60percent of the men who didn't exercise developed high blood pressure. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Another health bonus the researchers discovered was that the blood pressure of the men whoexercised was 25 percent below the average of men their age. </span> </font> </p>

    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="19" __label="true"> Research has also shown exercise is good for the mind. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="20" __label="true"> In a recent study at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., researchers compared 62 exercisers,ages 55 to 91, with an equal number of people in the same age bracket who didn't exercise todetermine the possible effects regular activity might have on cognitive skills. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Both groups were given a one-hour series of tests assessing memory, reaction time andreasoning. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="22" __label="true"> The results? The exercisers performed significantly better in all reaction-time tests, all reasoningtests and in two of the three memory tests. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="23" __label="true"> "I think this study strongly suggests that exercise is important in preserving our mental abilities aswe grow older," said Louis Clarkson Smith, Ph.D., who conducted the research with Alan A.Hartley, Ph.D. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <b> <span __num="24" __label="true"> The Benefits Of Walking </span> </b> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="25" __label="true"> According to Partnership member Mark Fenton, "The elderly have some special physical concernsthat can be helped with regular exercise like walking." </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="26" __label="true"> "As people get older," he said, "they seem to be at greater risk of developing osteoporosis andwith regular exercise like walking, that seems to be forestalled." </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Fenton, editor of the Boston-based </span> <i> <span __num="28" __label="true"> Walking Magazine </span> </i> <span __num="29" __label="true"> , adds that the psychologicalbenefits of regular physical activity for older adults are immense. </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="30" __label="true"> "We see again and again that regular exercise gives an improved sense of self-worth and animproved sense of purpose," he said. "It's also clear that regular activity may reduce the likelihoodof clinical depression -- a problem among the elderly who may begin to feel they are a burden totheir family. With regular exercise, they can continue to be contributing members of society and ifthey want, they can get involved in volunteer work or part-time work." </span> </font> </p> 
    <p> <font face="arial"> <span __num="31" __label="true"> Other health benefits from regular physical activity such as walking include: </span> </font> </p> 
    <ul> 
     <font face="arial"> <li> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Reduced risk of dying prematurely </span> </li> <li> <span __num="33" __label="true"> Decreased risk of dying from heart disease </span> </li> <li> <span __num="34" __label="true"> Decreased risk of developing colon cancer </span> </li> <li> <span __num="35" __label="true"> Reduced risk of developing high blood pressure </span> </li> <li> <span __num="36" __label="true"> Help in reducing blood pressure in people who already have high blood pressure </span> </li> <li> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Decreased risk of developing diabetes </span> </li> <li> <span __num="38" __label="true"> Lower risk of developing hypertension </span> </li> <li> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Increased muscle strength, flexibility and sense of balance, all of which reduce the risk of falls </span> </li> <li> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Help in controlling weight </span> </li> </font> 
    </ul> 
    <font face="arial"> <span __num="41" __label="true"> "I think what's really notable is just how much benefit there is for older adults to be physicallyactive," DL Pratt said. "We used to think that once you got to a certain age, it really didn't makeany difference anymore, but what we're finding out is that even men and women into their ninetiescan see major increases in cardiovascular fitness and strength with regular physical activity." </span> <p> <b> <span __num="42" __label="true"> America's Exercise Habits </span> </b> </p> <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> Exercise seems to be something that comes naturally to people who were born and raised beforethe automobile boom and are now in their eighties and nineties, according to Maggie Spilner, aneditor for </span> <i> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Walking </span> </i> <span __num="45" __label="true"> magazine who has written a column on walking for the publicationsince 1988. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="46" __label="true"> "My grandmother walked to work every day because she didn't know how to drive a car but mymother, who is now 74, drives her car everywhere and doesn't get any more exercise than what ittakes to run a household," she said. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> "From what I have seen, our parents have been at greater risk than any other generation," shesaid. "They were caught in the middle of an industrialization movement in this country." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Spilner said those who are now in their nineties relied on foot for the most part to get aroundwhile the generation that followed developed daily patterns that depended on automobiles."Our generation knows enough to exercise," she said, "but the lifestyle of our parents sappedthem of any exercise. </span> </p> <p> <b> <span __num="49" __label="true"> Preventative Medicine </span> </b> </p> <p> <span __num="50" __label="true"> What health experts have now discovered is that regular exercise can help prevent many of theconditions that frequently lead to a ride in an ambulance to the hospital, according to Dan Manz, apast president of the National Association of State Emergency Medical Service Directors, aPartner agency. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="51" __label="true"> "From an emergency medical service perspective, what continues to be the leading ambulance callin America is cardiovascular problems and certainly the population that is highly at risk for that isthe elderly," Manz said. "Clearly aerobic exercise like walking is a key to reducing the risk ofheart attack." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> Manz cautioned, however, that those with heart problems should check with a physician beforebeginning an exercise program. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> According to Dr. Pratt, regular exercise can make a difference in the strength and endurance ofolder Americans. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> "We've found that loss of strength and endurance that appear to be due to aging are really due toinactivity," he said. "Studies show that one in three men and half of women are completelysedentary in their leisure by the time they reach 75-years-old." </span> </p> <p> <b> <span __num="55" __label="true"> The Independent Life </span> </b> </p> <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> By far the biggest difference regular exercise can make in an older person's life, however, is inincreasing their chances of remaining independent and able to care for themselves, Fentonsaid. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> "Exercise seems to be at the heart of maintaining functional mobility and independence and that'scritical for an older person," he said. "Regular exercise can mean the differencebetween acontinual fulfilled life or the beginning of their demise." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> Elberta Stutts, an 80-year-old retired employee of American Bakeries in Dorada, N.C., can attestto that. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="59" __label="true"> "I walk about three and a half miles a day in my neighborhood and the last time I had mycheck-up at the doctor's office, the nurse said: 'From what I can tell, you have the heart of anathlete."' </span> </p> <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> What's more, Mrs. Stutts said she has gotten to know her community through her daily walks. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> "I started walking for exercise when I quit work and I only knew maybe the next door neighbor orthe neighbor across the street," she said. "But I've gotten to know everybody in the neighborhoodnow. What's so near is that when I don't walk for a couple of days, my neighbors start calling me,wanting to know why I haven't been out walking." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Mrs. Stutts added that her daily walks keep her feeling positive about life. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> "I can be feeling down and I can get out and walk and it helps me a lot to keep my head onstraight," she said. </span> </p> <p> <b> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Start Now! </span> </b> </p> <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> It might also be of interest for seniors to know that it's never too late to begin exercising, said Dr.Pratt. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> "One of the issues with older adults, particularly with women, is that many have grown upthinking that exercise is not for them," he said. "They think if they're not athletes, they shouldn'tbe active." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> "To this, I would like to say that it's never too late to start. Most of the benefits of exercise thataccrue for younger adults also apply to older adults, no matter when they begin exercising," hesaid. </span> </p> <p> <font size="-1"> <span __num="68" __label="true"> This article was written for the Partnership for a Walkable America by Emily Smith of theUniversity of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center </span> <br> <span __num="69"> Phone: (919) 962-2202 </span> <br> <span __num="70"> FAX (919) 962-8710 </span> </font> </p> </font>
