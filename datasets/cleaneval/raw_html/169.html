We support your negotiations toward peace. I affirm the saying in Swahili, which says, "When the cattle join together the lion goes to sleep hungry."

They are actually members of the NSCC. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> Secondly, we would like to recognise other organisations, such as CEAS andWorld Vision who have provided considerable support in preparation for thisconference. As well, there are a host of other organisations who stand with usand support us. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Now I call upon Commissioner of Tonj Country, Andrew Kuac Mayol, to speak tous. </span> <i> <span __num="49" __label="true"> (Exchange of song begins, Jieng, Nuer, reciprocally) </span> </i> </p> <i> </i> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="50" __label="true"> Andrew Kuac Mayol: </span> </b> <span __num="51" __label="true"> Brothers and sisters in the Conference I greet you inthe name of the Chairman of the Movement, Dr. John Garang de Mabior. I alsogreet you in the name of the people of Tonj County. It was really a concern ofour people yesterday that our people did not see me welcoming our guests to thismeeting house. People were saying that, as a commissioner of this place, I wouldsay a word of welcome to the delegates in general. Let me proceed, because itwould have been good for me to welcome yesterday so that the Commander and theGovernor were also to hear what the Commissioner of TC was saying. But sincethat could not happen, let me proceed with a brief speech, even though that isnot equal to the speech I had prepared yesterday. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="52" __label="true"> When we come to the purpose for which we have gathered, we were informed lastSeptember that there would be a Nuer Dinka meeting in Tonj County. Preparationswere made then, but somewhere in the middle we began to doubt that the meetingmight not be a success. Why were we doubting? We were doubting because, in thecourse of preparations, there were things that were supposed to be done. But wefound that little or nothing had been done as far as some services hadproceeded. Communication was not prompt from Nairobi to our end. We werereceiving communication at some points, but at others we were lost in the line.There were times when we had difficulty knowing who was to do what, who was toprepare what. But in time we found that Mr. Mario Muor Muor and Tular Deng hadbeen given certain responsibilities. I came to this place to speak with thechiefs asking that they get on with the work of construction as quickly aspossible. Building got underway, as did the digging of a well. However, it isunfortunate that we have only one well, which results in the congestion which wehave experienced. So later on when we saw Mr. Mario running back and forth, wewere struck by words like those of Shakespeare, which said: ?? We knew that wewould have to redouble our efforts. Buildings would have to be built quickly.Like these buildings were build quickly in a way that is inadequate to themodern way of preparation. This is why we have many of us sitting on the ground.So much for that, let us proceed. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="53" __label="true"> Here, let us come to the very matter for which we have gathered. It is goodto say that we are here to record a very important event in Tonj county inparticular. This is a rare opportunity, hardly to be equalled in our history.The Nuer and the Dinka are one people given their social and culturalbackgrounds. But in the course of time we have been divided by the enemies ofthe people to fight ourselves. However, it is okay because all of us are awarethat sons quarrel with their father, and daughters with their mothers, but therecomes a time when a family sits together to resolve their differences.Yesterday, who could not see the white bull outside here? The bull that was veryfierce, that was almost on the neck of everyone who passed? That bull was notbrought by accident, but it was brought by design, and that was a design forpeace. So, with the words of the spearmasters over this bull yesterday, Ithought that the entire effort was finished, and that we had come here simplyfor formalities. If we did understand the words of the spearmasters talkingoutside over the bull, and even inside here, I don't think we have much more tosay. It has been done. We have only to reflect on the wise resolutions which wecan make to bring the words spoken to their fulfilment. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="54" __label="true"> Something small that I would have said before, I will have to say now. Ourmeeting for peace has brought people from far away. Dr. Peter Nyot is here fromGermany, and Michael Wal has come from the US, both have come from afar to joinwith us. This shows us that this is a serious matter since those from far awayare joining with us here. As well, our foreign press people show that this is aworld-wide concern, since organisations from far away have sent theirrepresentatives. We have even asked ourselves concerning some people, how theyhave come, if they were invited by the churches or other people. I'm seeingbrother Samuel Aru with a very serious delegation from Khartoum, so I have askedmyself if Omer Bashir is interested in peace. Anyway, translation of this kind,makes a very short speech, to be far too long. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Therefore I'll conclude by speaking to the Dinka Chiefs and the Nuer Chiefs.Mine is a word of caution to you. You spoke well yesterday as spearmasters, aselders, and as leaders. I would want that to be repeated today. because we havecome here to look for peace and reconciliation and unity. I am not saying thatyou should not air out your views, but that you should air out your views in aconstructive manner. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here.You are to say your viewpoints here cool headed, rationally, and without raisingyour emotions. All of us, the intellectual guest, are here to help you come tohelpful resolutions. You must say the right thing. It may happen that at somepoint one of you will call for us to close the discussion because we are allsaying the same things. Avoid unhelpful arguments, matters that are notnecessary in our discussion of peace and reconciliation. Let us avoid mattersthat look like we are in the courtroom. This is not a court we are creatinghere. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> So, before I go, I would like my counterpart, the Commissioner, to come here,so that we extend to each other, the greetings of peace. </span> <i> <span __num="57" __label="true"> (The NuerCommissioner comes forward, and the two grasp hands, holding their hands aloftbefore the community; the people on both sides respond with songs, chants,affirming the meeting. Nuer move into a full chant with extended responses). </span> </i> </p> <i> </i> <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> TD: I don't have much to do, since the Commissioner has already invited theCommissioner from Leer. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="59" __label="true"> Commissioner of Ler, Joseph Juac Kon: </span> </b> <span __num="60" __label="true"> I'm greeting you in the name ofGod, in the name of our land, you, the Dinka and Nuer, our guests, and you whohave organised this conference. As well, I'm speaking of the peace that wassigned on the 21st April, 1997. So I'm greeting in the name of the PeaceAgreement. I am the person responsible in the government of Dr. Riak Machar forthe Co-ordinating Council. I also greet you in the name of this Council. Whenthe government was formed, the former commanders who were in the bush, thesewere chosen to become the governors. . . . Maker Macek. When I was appointed andcame to Leer as its Commissioner, I was told that there was a grassroots peaceinitiative. Some of my leaders were taken to Loki for the meetings, and soon anumber of abductees taken from our people were returned to us. I was there toreceive them as they came home. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> I came here with fourteen chiefs from my area and others from other areas,such regions as Akoba and Nasir on the East Bank. And those far north of Bantiu.We all came together with firm hope and enthusiasm for this peace. We camehoping that the Nuer and Dinka will be able to live in peace. We, the Nuer fromthe Western Upper Nile, all came, except those from Menkin in the Bul area. Youall know the conflict that continues there, and we ask you to hope with us thatthe fighting in that region will be brought to an end. I came here with thefirst Brigade Commander, and Acting Zonal Commander, Peter Pajiek, we cametogether so that he can talk to his forces, to preserve the resolutions of thisimportant, historical occasion. We also came with Commander Gabriel Both Yol whois in charge of security in the Leer State. As well, because of the support ofthis peace by Dr. Riak Macar, the General Secretary of the USDF has also come sothat he can report back the resolutions that are made here. Gabriel Yuol Dok, asSecretary of the Party is with us. The Khartoum Agreement was signed by SamuelAru. He did not come here because he is a son of this area but because he iswith Riak in the Government, and he has come to witness this important event.The Southern Defence Forces/Movement are represented by Commander Peter Riir Puk, </span> <i> <span __num="62" __label="true"> (PRP comes forward and says that all the senior officers of the SPLA knowme). </span> </i> <span __num="63" __label="true"> The speech of the Governor of Bahr el Ghazel, Nhial Deng Nhial, made mevery happy, when he said that the matter is not simply for the organisations tocome together, but that we share common objectives. Having heard this we allslept very soundly, with the hope of these words. Also, as we are witnessingpeople as they speak, we are further convinced by the actions of Commander Selva.We are glad to see his firm, practical commitment to facilitating this efforttoward peace between our peoples. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> I want to correct the statement made by our elder William, yesterday, when hesaid that he was a thief. He did not mean that he himself was a thief. We areall children of one father. Those who are raiding cattle are William's children,and thus he identifies with them. It seems this was misunderstood. Historically,we Nuer, have so many Dinka with us, and so many of our chiefs were originallyDinka. When Dinka came to settle in our land, we usually gave him the firstplace, choosing him as leader. We have no difficulty with a man from afar beinga leader among our people. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> I conclude my speech offering that history. I greet you all in the name ofJesus Christ our Lord. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="66" __label="true"> TD: </span> </b> <span __num="67" __label="true"> (What commander Selva said as he opened his remarks yesterday wassimply a joke. There was no reference to the elder, William himself. It wassimply a humorous comment). Our next speakers will be women, one from Bahr elGhazel, and one from Upper Nile. The first is Awut from Bahr el Ghazel, to befollowed by Deborah Nyandien from Upper Nile </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="68" __label="true"> Awut Deng Acuil: </span> </b> <span __num="69" __label="true"> I am called Awut, a woman of Rek and Agar Dinka. I haven't nothing great to say today. In terms of age I am younger than most ofyou. I am only a child. The joy of the In such occasions, whether you are youngor old, it will not prohibit from the young from speaking. I greet you all, andconsider you all as my children. Women gives birth to a man, who becomes a whitehaired elder. What I want to say is that this gives us great joy that Nuer andDinka should come together for all of us have suffered, with many women andchildren killed during the fighting between our peoples. I express myappreciation to NSCC and all affiliated churches that have brought us together.I express my thanks to both for SPLA as well as the USDF, for if they had notagreed, it would not have been possible for us to meet in this way. I thank allthe chiefs and elders, Nuer and Dinka, who have come here knowing that fightingwill get us nowhere, and that we must discuss our differences in this importantgathering. I thank the foreigners who have come all the way to Wunlit to sitdown with us and observe our negotiations. I will not speak long. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="70" __label="true"> This is not a court, but a process of reconciliation. The women of Bahr elGhazel, concerning their children, those they have given birth to, that they don't want their offspring to be killed any more. Yesterday someone said thatthe women had stopped bearing children. Not only have they ceased to bear, butthey wish that those who are in the army, as combatants could return to theirwombs again. It is both the women of Nuer and Dinka who have borne children, butit is not our desire that our young should die without good reason. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="71" __label="true"> What I beseech you, the chiefs and elders of Nuer and Dinka, that you willsettle these differences, that you come to final resolutions to stop the killingof our children. I'll do as the Commissioner of Tonj has just done, I call onDebora to come forward that we as women can greet one another (Debora comesforward; Awut begins to sing, "Dooray, dooray, we have come for peace"). We hopeyou have heard our voices. I've come to express my joy in this peace effort. Ihave nothing more to say, and give place to Deborah. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="72" __label="true"> Deborah Nyandien: </span> </b> <span __num="73" __label="true"> I will speak, and I will use my Nuer language.

When they travelled, they went to settle nearYirol where my uncle, Nyibol, my uncles are here now. When I married, byaccident, Mathiang Gok knew that their daughter was taken back to Nuerland.

People of God, you the NSCC, and all related churches, I greet youwith appreciation for your efforts to bring our peoples, Nuer and Dinka, willhave peace. I also greet all our guests who are here. Specifically, I greet BillLowrey, with thanks a hundred times over for his efforts throughout this longprocess until we meet at this stage. The two communities who first went toBilpham to train to fight this war against the Arabs. I greet our elder SamuelAru Bol who has come to witness this meeting.

Six women havecome from Khartoum, all Dinka women have come to observe. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="75" __label="true"> The Nuer women have sent a message to the Dinka women, which I now declare.This is similar to that given by Awut our sister. Since the 1960s, beginning ofthe war of Anyanya I, we want to know from the men, why our children should bedying like this all these years! My word is like that of Awut. You the Nuer andDinka women, and even those from outside, I want to ask the men this question.What I ask is how it is that, since the creation of the earth, whether in all ofhistory any man has died with a child in his womb? I'm not asking for an answer,but I want you to think about it. Be quiet, and consider this question. I'll addthis as well: Has any man ever felt the great pains of labour in giving birth?Women, we alone know the pain of giving birth, and our words and our thoughtsmust be taken seriously. Don't discard the importance of our words! You Dinkaand Nuer don't often consider the thoughts of women, but today hear us clearly,concerning all the children have died among us. I'm saying this because , whileyour are in discussion, , know that we will watch you carefully. If you don'tultimately take our words seriously, then you must understand we will make arevolution, and we will stop giving birth. I know you men are laughing becauseyou say you are married through payment of bride price over which women have nocontrol, and also that women have no power to make a revolution against you.However, we are speaking today, not as the women of the past. I exhort you also,not to discuss, without taking a break from your deliberations. Take anoccasional break.

When we met in Loki thechiefs and churchleaders from the West side of the Nile put together their plansfor this conference. One of the things they said was that this would be aconference of the people, in which local people would take the lead, and itwould not include poliltical leaders. They may be present as observers but notas participants. They said that all of the people must be mobilised toparticipate in this conference, that NSCC should prepare the Conference, andthat observers from around the world must be invited to attend. So for thesemany months there have been numerous people involved. Gradually the group haschanged, with women and chiefs always part of the process, and always there hasbeen the desire to have Dinka and Nuer from outside as full partners in theprocess. So I now want to introduce you to some of those people who are herenow. Some are not present, but have worked hard over the months, but I'llintroduce you to those who are now with us. The Chairman of our Team is Dr.Haruun Ruun. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="97" __label="true"> We have two people who have worked to mobilise the people in BeG and inWestern upper Nile. One is Rev. Matthew Mathiang Deng. The second is Judge TelarDeng. We have had two women who have been involved with us, Awut Deng whom youheard speak this morning. The second is Nyawaraga Joshua who is not able to bewith us today. We have asked intellectuals from the Diaspora to come and be partof this team. One of those is Dr. Peter Nyot Kok from Germany, and the other isDr. Michael Lual Duany from the USA. Always, as it was possible, we have askedthat Chiefs meet with us so that they could observe if we were keeping on thepath that was set for us at Loki. And I, Dr. Bill Lowrey, have served as afacilitator for this Team. The two chiefs who have been most involved with usthroughout this process are, first, Chief Dut Malual, who I understand is sickin Nairobi, and we are missing him. The second of them is Chief Isaac Magok fromLeer (stands, waving his fly whisk). </span> </p> <p> <span __num="98" __label="true"> Now I would like to tell you a short story from the Bible, that sets thestage for the Dinka to tell their story before the Nuer, and for the Nuer totell their story before the Dinka. This is a story that I told in Loki for thechiefs and leaders in Loki, and that was the beginning of three days in whichthey told their stories, each group to the other. As you know, today is Sunday,which is the first day of the week. It was on a Sunday, after Jesus had died onthe cross and been raised from the dead, that this story took place. Most of thedisciples were together in a special room, but one was missing. His name wasThomas. And suddenly Jesus appeared in the room, and his message was, "Peace bewith you." The disciples were excited to see him, but when they told Thomas, hewould not believe it. He said, unless I see him, and put my fingers in his sidewhere the spear went in, I will not believe it. One week later, again on aSunday, Jesus appeared in the room and Thomas was present. Jesus said to Thomas,"Reach out your fingers and feel the wound where the spear went in." </span> </p> <p> <span __num="99" __label="true"> This is a conference about reconciliation. Thomas could not be reconcileduntil he could see the wounds that he had helped to cause, and touch the placeswhere Jesus had been wounded. For seven and a half years now, Nuer have causedwounds and injuries to the Dinka, and for seven and a half years now, Dinka havecaused wounds and injuries to the Nuer. If you want to be reconciled you musttell each other the wounds you have suffered, you must look at each other, andreach out and touch one another in the places where you have been wounded. Itwill be important that you speak the truth, that you not hide anything fromanother, so that the reconciliation goes deep, and it is a genuine healing ofthe wounds you have inflicted. When you speak the truth, when you say the hardthings to each other, when you identify the issues that must be solved, then youcan reconcile relationships, and you can walk out of here, saying now we arebrothers and sisters once again. In just a few minutes, you as the Dinka, willbegin to tell the Nuer your stories. Do not hold back. Tell the true stories, nomatter how painful it may be. In just a few minutes, when the Dinka tell theirstories, you Nuer, you must listen carefully. Do not debate with them, do notargue with them. Relationships begin with listening. And when they have finishedyou will tell your stories to them. The time of beautiful speeches is over. Itis now time for the hard work of peace. You must make a peace that will last.When I sit down, this will be your work. You, Nuer and Dinka, must make thispeace and determine how deep the peace will go. May God give you the strengthyou need. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="100" __label="true"> TD: </span> </b> <span __num="101" __label="true"> Okay, I introduce to you Dr. Peter Nyot Kok, who will take the chairas the Dinka present their narratives. The first speaker will be Chief Dut Yol. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="102" __label="true"> Dr. Peter Nyot Kok: </span> </b> <span __num="103" __label="true"> I greet you warmly, you Nuer and Dinka, you chiefsand elders, women and youth, you soldiers, may you all be blessed here. The talktoday and onwards is for you the chiefs to talk, not me. However, after you haveconcluded your statements, I will speak. Peace and reconciliation beganyesterday when a white bull was sacrificed, and libations were poured. We hadalready raised the house of peace, but what remains is the plastering of thewalls and floor and roofing of the building of peace. However, this is not easywork that is before us. If we plaster the house wrongly it is likely thatinsects will still bight us. If we don't put up good poles it is likely that thehouse will leak. I will start with what Bill Lowrey has said, that we must drawfrom the experience of our ancestors. We do each stage of the work so that it issuccessful, and it is a solid house. During our meeting we will begin with thechiefs who attended the meeting in Loki, and we will move ahead so that arepresentative from each county has opportunity to speak. I am appealing to thetranslators who are speaking in Dinka, Nuer or English that you work totranslate accurately, because this is a difficult aspect of our work. Now I willcall Chief Kulong Marial and, secondly, Chief Juol Macok. Together they willhave one hour to speak. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="104" __label="true"> Chief Kulong Marial: </span> </b> <span __num="105" __label="true"> I will not speak at length. I have been a chief fora long time, in the area of Mapeer in Rumbek. By ethnic group I am Agar from BeGRegion. Some months ago I attended the meeting in Loki for the purpose ofreconciliation between Dinka and Nuer. When I returned from Loki I disseminatedthe content of the Accord among Dinka and Nuer. Recently, I also participated inthe exchange visits of the Chiefs, stopping at Leer, and here. Yesterday webegan our reconciliation by offering a white bull, and we said all that neededto be said, and the bull is now in its eternal existence above. It has alwaysbeen our traditional practice that, when we have conflicts, as we often do, wemake sacrifice and we are able to reconcile and return to our normal life.Usually we conclude by confirming an accord between ourselves and Nuer with anaccord that states we will no longer raid one another so there is no more lossof property or life. At the end of every conference we come out withdeclarations which are sent to Leer, Mapeer, Tonj, and elsewhere, confirmingthat we should no longer fight each other. And the present reconciliation, beingassisted by the churches, means that we address the issues that divide us andbring conflict and we put an end to them. Sometimes back we had a conference inGainlel, and we sacrificed bulls and that concluded our conflicts between Dinkaand Nuer. As well, we had a conference at Wuniloor, and that meeting ended ourproblems until the conflicts of Anyanya I brought out new conflicts betweenDinka and Nuer. The border conflicts intensified again with the tension betweenSPLA and Nuer, giving thieves concerned with their own well-being opportunity toexploit our differences. As well, our differences have been exploited by ourenemies. D&amp;N are brothers, who share common borders. With our sacrificeyesterday our hostility was brought to an end. There are people who are againstthis peace agreement, who have benefited from our hostility. There will be somewho will come trying to persuade our peoples on each side to believe that theother will not be faithful to our agreement, but we must not listen to thesedeceptive words. We have always been fighting each other, D&amp;N, but has neverbefore happened that we deserted lands such as Mapeer. Today it is other peoplewho have come in to exacerbate these conflicts. An example is that our ancestralhome of Rumbek was in the hand in the enemy. Now that we have captured it fromthe enemy we have made alterations and we are able to occupy our own landscomfortably. As I said, in respect to Rumbek, I can now return to my ancestralhome of Mapeer and we can settle there once again. Normally, in the relationshipbetween us and Nuer, what keeps conflicts from being concluded, is when variouspretexts are brought up, saying we must locate the thief, and find the detailsof the case. All of these are delaying tactics, which should not deter us frompeaceful coexistence. Yesterday we sealed our covenant. It is not in Dinkatradition that we should begin accusing one another, or quarrelling with oneanother, after sacrifice is offered. We should not be doing this here. Ourgathering here is heard all over the world, in Khartoum and Juba, and many otherplaces. Thus, in my view, there is no use in talking about past grievances. Whatwe need to focus on is concrete actions to be taken to bring peacefulco-existence between our peoples. From this day forward we must stop the killingof women and children, and destruction of our properties. We reconcile ourselvesfrom Yirol, Rumbek and Bentiu. I will not proceed further with my address. Thisis the message I'm telling the people of Gogrial and Tuic, that ourreconciliation was concluded yesterday with the offering of our white bull. Thisis my word. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="106" __label="true"> PNK: </span> </b> <span __num="107" __label="true"> We have heard Chief Kulong Marial. Our second speaker is Chief JolMacok. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="108" __label="true"> Chief Jul Macok Lieny: </span> </b> <span __num="109" __label="true"> I am Agar from Rumbek. I am grateful to all whohave organised this conference. I'm grateful to Bill Lowrey and greet him. Iwarmly greet my brothers from Bentiu, as well as those from BeG. Also, I greetthose from Nairobi. We are here for peace and reconciliation, which we haveaccepted. This conference we declare that we have fully accepted thisreconciliation. If we were in a court I would have asked questions from thepeople of Bentiu. When people first began going to Bongo, the training camp, itwas because of the problem of the South that took them. When those who went toBongo split apart, it was unfortunate that we accepted that separation. I neverthought there was a government in Leer, until I saw the Commissioner of Leer. Ihave no bad commissioner from Leer. When we said earlier that we should savelives, I also accept fully what you said, because I have a border with ChiefMalual Wun. In my community I have a few people from Bentiu, like those stayinghere at Wunlit. Our relationship with the people of Adoor, that is those ofYirol and Rumbek, is that we are children of one family. We had no part in thedivision that had happened. When I said I wanted to ask question of the peopleof Bentiu, I actually wanted to ask questions of those of Adoor. As a goodgesture, and to declare that we accept peace, I want to say that those whoraided cattle on the 18th have now been apprehended, and the cattle are to bereturned. The civil administration in Rumbek ordered all chiefs to apprehend theraiders and return the cattle. This has now been done. </span> <i> <span __num="110" __label="true"> (TD: I believe ChiefChul was speaking of two raids. One was on the 19th of February, and the otheron the 8th. I believe that the those who were responsible for the first havebeen apprehended.) </span> </i> <span __num="111" __label="true"> Before all who are in attendance here I want to affirmthat we have agreed to accept the peace between us. At present we have peoplewho have gone from Yirol to Adoor and they have been welcomed by the residents.I will conclude here by saying that we have reconciled with the people of MalualWun as of today. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="112" __label="true"> PNK: </span> </b> <span __num="113" __label="true"> We have one half of an hour remaining from the time given to Rumbek,and we invite any other speakers from Rumbek, if they have anything tocontribute. From Rumbek we have previously four people. We have Marial MalwalArop and Col Madul Rilpiou. I now give opportunity to Chief Marial Malual Arop,to speak toward a peace that cannot be broken, cannot be demeaned by crooks. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="114" __label="true"> Chief Marial Malual Arop: </span> </b> <span __num="115" __label="true"> What I have to say is brief. Our father, MalualWun, I greet them with those who came with him. I also greet all the chiefs fromBeG. I want to greet our father Malual Wun is because he was active workingtogether with my father. When Chief Kulong returned from Loki I asked if ChiefMalual was still alive. Malual is now the only one remaining chief with sons ofthe chiefs who once were his counterparts. We are all children, of this onefather who remains, Malual Wun. If there is a complicated problem, and yourfather is still alive, he would be the one who restrains the children from selfdestruction. The wisdom of CMW and our wisdom is not the same. He began workingsince the time of the British with our fathers. Most of us began working duringthe time of independence with the Arabs. We have always thought that CMW of thesaying in Dinka. A lion said to a father to give him his children so he couldeat them. Today all our fathers are gone except CMW. The lion ate all theelderly people, but one old person was hidden by his children. The lion that atethe elderly people happened to swallow a snake with water. The snake would comefrom his stomach, peaking out from his mouth. On person suggested that he bringand old man to take the snake from the stomach of the lion, wouldn't the lioneat the old man? The lion accepted the old man to be brought. He came and askedthe lion to lay down, and tied a rat to the leg of the lion. Then the snakecrawled out to eat the snake. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="116" __label="true"> To you, our father Malual, you are the only father of all our peoples amongD&amp;N. Now we want to draw out the snake now. If you have accepted that thesnake in your stomach should be brought out by the rat we have accepted to bringout the snake, and that is why we have killed the white bull yesterday. Let yourlion not come again to attack the children and the women. How could we refuse toaccept peace? The </span> <i> <span __num="117" __label="true"> toc </span> </i> <span __num="118" __label="true"> which we have been sharing. Is your area Ganlil nowempty of people? We have accepted reconciliation. When we bypass what ourbrother said before, and we sit to discuss the past grievances, we are quenchingthe fire with water and not quenching the fire with more fire. If there is anydisagreement between the sides then we will not reach our conclusion. Let usclose the old chapter since Anyanya I and begin a new chapter. This is not acourt. If it were a court we would enumerate our grievances. If we are committedto reconciliation, let us not account for the past. Let us simply enter thereconciliation and act as brothers. Let peace multiply as each person acceptspeace and returns home to plant this seed among his own people. We people ofRumbek, we have a commissioner. We are following the policy that has been put inour mind since the conflict began. We are continuing with it. To conclude mytalk, it is that we used quarrelled in the past, but today our conflict isdifferent. I believe we are one, we can follow each other's footsteps. We havenow accepted reconciliation and peace. If people sit in such a house as this,this is a house of God. And if somebody comes against this you, our brother.Whatever the quarrel in the past, let it conclude. My word stops here. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="119" __label="true"> PNK: </span> </b> <span __num="120" __label="true"> I thank you for your word, you people of Rumbek. Those of Rumbek areleft with 5 minutes. Chief Col Madol Arilpiou will speak in this time. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="121" __label="true"> Chief Col Madol Arilpiou: </span> </b> <span __num="122" __label="true"> The first person I will greet is God. As we arehere in this house of God, we have been taught by the Christians. God hatesJealousy and hatred. God has tied the leg of hatred down now. This jealousy iscalled You, our brothers, Nuer, and Jieng, we have been made to collide. The twopieces of wood that have been put together to cause the fire. God has dividedthings long ago. He gave Nuer the young cow. He gave Dinka the old cow. Thisbrought conflict, that we must now bring to an end. We Dinka we are willing toaccept reconciliation with all our hearts, but we have some doubt about ourbrothers Nuer. You, Nuer, when we have something good, you change it intosomething bad the following day. The reason I say this, is that we went to Bongobecause we have a problem. The Arab claims this land. When we went to Bongo itwas because of that problem with the Arabs, but then we began to quarrel amongourselves. We have killed ourselves in greater numbers than our original enemyever killed us. The conflict between D&amp;N, has led to the point that thewomen are now the ones who die in large numbers. In the old days the men diedand were eaten by birds, but today the women die. This has come from you Nuer.You are the cause of the death of women. You Malual, you stop that attitude, andstop killing women and children for no reason. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="123" __label="true"> PNK: </span> </b> <span __num="124" __label="true"> The addresses of Rumbek County are finished, and I thank you threechiefs. We have heard your words in full. As well I thank our brothers Nuer forlistening carefully to what has been said. This is not the end of those who willspeak. We will continue in the days ahead. Now we turn to the list of Chiefs ofTonj County which I have just received. There are three people: Chief Dut Yol,Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny, and our mother Sadia Manok. Just now I invite Dut Yolto come speak. You, people of Tonj County, you have but one hour to speak. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="125" __label="true"> Chief Dut Yol: </span> </b> <span __num="126" __label="true"> My name is Dut Yol Manyok, a man of Tonj County, and thesection of . I will not speak at length. What I will say first is that I ampleased that all our people have gathered here. First I will speak about thosethings that have gone bad between us. I don't know what has killed me. First ofall, we have simply been staying with the Nuer. When we went to the bush theytook our children. What made them to quarrel in Bongo we still don't understand.Those who stayed with us as our brothers, they began to kill us. Some werestaying with us and our people tried to kill them, but we refused. Those whowanted to return to their homes, we accompanied them. Some are still stayingwith us today. We have the chief called Mading Manyel who was killed togetherwith his entire family and 18 cattle camps. Also 150 people were killed, and 5of our young women were taken who are with them until the present day. When theycame they also attacked the section of Det Madheu. They took almost 20,000 headof cattle. 90 people were killed at once. Also, during the rainy season, theycame and attacked the place of Makuac. When they came back to attack for thesecond time they took everything, leaving not even a dog or a chicken. theyraided the entire cattle camp. All the homesteads were burned, all of Makuac wasburned to the ground. After 11 days Aboc was raided, Cattle camp of , Wunicuei, </span> </p> <p> <span __num="127" __label="true"> Mabior, Aboc, Makuac, Waiyaar CC, Wunicuei, Bikliir. They took all thechickens, the women children. Only a few of us remained who ran away. Now thatyou have come I am not angry, but happy. If even one person remains, and we havepeace, that person can multiply. What I'm not happy about is our brother Nuerwere the ones to start to explain why they have been killing me. This would havebeen far better. We have been reconciled by a man called Telar Ring in a placecalled Maal. Why they kill us, we would have preferred if they had spoken firstso that they can explain precisely why they have killed us as revenge. Sincethey are with us now, and they all know me. some of them have their childrenstaying with us here. Those children who I have accompanied back home, they arehome now. I now want our brothers to speak out the grievances they have againstme so I can understand. But the source of our quarrel is this, the Nuer and weare one. I don't look at them as enemies. We share one </span> <i> <span __num="128" __label="true"> toc </span> </i> <span __num="129" __label="true"> and one borderbetween us. We regard them as our elders to ourselves because their father iselder. When their father was born he could not her but was deaf. When my fatherwas born he was blind. He came in a secret way, my deaf uncle to raid my cattlebecause my father could not see. My father went to God and said that thisbrother comes and steals my cattle. And God said, okay, it is something good.God gave a girl to our Dinka father who was blind. Once he married, he neverproduced another blind man among his children. And the deaf father of Nuer neverproduced a deaf man. All their children have been healthy. I don't know what hashappened. After we have produced good children we still carry on this oldtradition because they have not liberated themselves from the way of theirfather. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Today God went to bring a foreigners and told them, if these two peoplesquarrel, stand between them, and see why they are quarrelling. Today, especiallyit is the Church leaders who have come here. It is the right time for them toask us what our problem is so that it can be resolved between us. What I know inmy heart this year, after they have killed our children, and killed ourchildren, and taken all our cattle, and all the goats, after all of this, whatremains is only their brother who is blind is their brother. They can take theirblind brother and kill him. This is not the first reconciliation talks. We beganthem in Gainlel, and again we came to Mal. Today, in Wunlit, this is the thirdpeace reconciliation. Those of you who have organised this conference, I ask youto invite our brother Nuer to speak out precisely what is in them, why they havedestroyed us. You who organised this conference, I will not bother to talk aboutthe loss of the cattle, or other property, or dead people. What we want fromyou, our brothers, are those young girls. Sincerely speaking, I ask you to sendour girls back, we will console ourselves with them. Please release them to us. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="131" __label="true"> The second point to finalise my talk: if we want to be reconciled. Yesterdaythe white bull was killed. I will go back to my home and sit in my house, andtry to buy simple goat.

At the end of his talk, and as a sign of hisreconciliation he has offered his had to the Nuer chief. Now we invite Chief GumMading Akucbeny. While we relay our story telling about past events, we alsowant to point to action we need to take to make peace in the future. We havebetween Gum Mading and Chief ... one half an hour. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="134" __label="true"> Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny: </span> </b> <span __num="135" __label="true"> From the beginning I want to tell you this(begins to sing his own song, to which people respond; begins by saying, "I amGum Mading . . ."). My name is Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny. I thank God and theNSCC for choosing Wunlit as a location for this conference. To my mind a genuinereconciliation will not include only D&amp;N, but it must include all SouthernSudanese. This conference has also provided us with opportunity to meet with ourchildren who have been cut off from us in Khartoum whom we've not met for a verylong time. This conference has also provided an opportunity for our kinfolk inEurope and America to come so that we can meet one another. It is very good thatour children whom we've taken to school to learn English and Arabic have alsocome to Wunlit, and that all people will now be able to hear that we have met atWunlit to bring peace to the land. Yesterday during the opening the militaryauthorities of the SPLA were here and we have seen them. We did not, however,know that there were military and civil administration from Bentiu who werelikewise with us. We are glad to hear that there is a military commander comingdirectly from where Riak is staying to be in our deliberations, and that he willreturn to tell Riak of our progress. </span> </p> <p> <span __num="136" __label="true"> The first thing I would like to say, concerns we chiefs, who have remainedwith our people in S. Sudan and sent our children to schools or to Bilpham fortraining. The problems that occurred at Bilpham did not begin there, but theyoriginated right here prior to their departure. In 1984 a group of young menfrom Gogrial and Tonj began departing for Bilpham. As they went they naturallyhad to pass through Nuerland. As they reached Abuong they were intercepted. Manywere killed and others were drowned while some returned. This had nothing to dowith the leadership. In the spirit of reconciliation we must begin with thegenesis of the problem. It is not with the leadership. We would like to know thechief who was responsible for the killing of our young men as they were en routeto Bilpham. It is important to begin with the genesis of the problem. That iswhy I asked for the senior military commander. That route through Abuong becameunsafe for our the passage of our people and we were forced to move any partiesthrough Bor area as our only alternative route. I challenge you, asking someoneto come and tell me that this is not the real state of affairs, as I havedescribed it. The route through Bor was a far longer route for our people. Whenwe decide to reconcile and become one, I must tell you that, currently, we nowhave two of our people with you in Nuer. They have now devastated Gograil, . . .and Tuic areas. When you prepared to come, did you first really speak with themto ask what they intend to do. If we are sincere about reconciliation I addressmyself to those from Nuer area. You have with us Carbino Kwanyiny Bol and Matip.Does it really make sense for us to reconcile if they are not with us, becausethese two people are with you now. If we reconcile without their participation Ibelieve our efforts will be incomplete. s we are all Southerners, we have lostour women and children, cattle and properties. I am glad to here that theCommissioner from Bentiu is here with us. As you saw yesterday, we haveresponsible people with us here from our side. I would hope we can also speakwith Riak Machar to tell him that we as Southerners have lost everything wepossess through our conflicts. First let us be practical, you the chiefs from Nand from D. As you have seen yesterday, we don't have an army. YesterdayGovernor Nhial Deng Nhial and Commander Selva Kiir were here to guard anyagreement we come to in this place. What about you? Who will ensure that ouragreement stands firm in your areas? When Chief Majok came here . . . Tell me,if we go to your area will we find that our Dinka are still alive there? As Isaid before, the Nuer are here with their property, they are here with theircattle and their children. If you want to take them with you are welcome to takethem. But I would only ask that you reciprocate, allowing our Dinka people toreturn to us also. I conclude with greetings, and emphasise before theorganisers, that this peace and reconciliation will be monitored, so that theDinka can go to Nuerland and claim their properties and likewise the Nuer cancome to Dinkaland to receive what belongs from them. </span> </p> <b> </b> <p> <b> <span __num="137" __label="true"> PNK: </span> </b> <span __num="138" __label="true"> I thank the two chiefs who have spoken now for their penetratinginsights.
