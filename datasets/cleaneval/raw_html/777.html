The clear cool breeze is on your face first thing in the morning, and the children have new energy and interest in the season. Autumn is here and isn't it beautiful? A time for harvesting, canning, preserving and getting stocked up for winter -- and the perfect time for reflecting on the many things for which we should be thankful. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="7" __label="true"> I number among these: God, our family, our home, our love and our great country. We have indeed been blessed in this country, as were our forefathers and the early celebrants of that first Thanksgiving in America -- both the Pilgrims and the Indians that shared the meal and celebration together. At our house, we use this time of gratitude and counting our blessings to study that first Thanksgiving as an integral part of our homeschool studies. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="8" __label="true"> As with any unit study topic, I try to pick out all of the important subtopics, crossing the curriculum spectrum many times. For example, when studying Thanksgiving, there is plenty of historical information to examine, along with geography (ocean crossings, continents, climates), science (plant varieties, growth, propagation, some of the sicknesses of the time, animal life in the region), art (N.C. Wyeth's paintings, clothing of the time, crafts), and reading (both fiction and nonfiction books). </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="9" __label="true"> When I first began preparing a unit study on Thanksgiving, I had the incorrect notion that my understanding of that period of American history was fairly complete. I was certainly proven wrong as we progressed through our study! I had not realized the extent of the sacrifice made by the Pilgrims over that 13 year period, traveling to Holland for years, and then finally returning to England to take part in the colonization of America. I never really knew or understood the origin of the "King James" version of the Bible and how it was connected to the Separatists. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="10" __label="true"> Each year, we focus on different aspects of the event. This year, we will take a look at what was involved in their survival in a new land -- when we started making our list of what we would do if we were the Pilgrims, my son chimed in "find a Walmart!" The reality of being in the middle of nowhere to maintain your religious beliefs, giving up what was so familiar and comfortable to go to an unknown destiny was pretty amazing to them. This was exactly the concept that I wanted them to understand -- </span> <b> <span __num="11" __label="true"> that sacrifices are oftentimes made for what you believe in, and to trust in the Lord to lead and protect you. </span> </b> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="12" __label="true"> As we work our way through </span> <font color="#0000FF"> <b> <a href="../thanksgiving.htm"> <span __num="13" __label="true"> this study </span> </a> </b> </font> <span __num="14" __label="true"> , we have many, many activities and studies that we enjoy. For example, a popular question has been over the difference in Indian corn and table corn, as we know it. This opens the door to an opportunity to help them learn more about the differences in plant varieties and about the gardening practices of both the Pilgrims and the Indians. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="15" __label="true"> Not only are we looking at some of their survival gardening, we are also trying to get a better understanding of what types of shelter they built, what kinds of sickness they had to deal with and why we don't have those illnesses today. There are many aspects of their daily living that we can't easily relate to from our own experience, and it is important for the children to "see" what life was like then, the tools they used, the things they did without, the responsibilities of each family member, and the importance of their faith and trust in God to provide for their needs. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="16" __label="true"> One of the books that opened my eyes to a broader view of the politics and history of the Pilgrims' journeys was </span> <em> <span __num="17" __label="true"> Saga of the Pilgrims: From Europe to the New World </span> </em> <span __num="18" __label="true"> , by John Harris (published by Globe Pequot Press). This book, written for the seventh grade and up, is very interesting reading and certainly presented a new perspective on these religious outcasts. I recommend that both parents and the older children read this one -- it is a very informative and interesting book to share and discuss. For the younger children, a comparable book might be </span> <em> <span __num="19" __label="true"> If You Sailed on the Mayflower in 1620 </span> </em> <span __num="20" __label="true"> , by Ann McGovern (published by Scholastic). </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="21" __label="true"> As we study the Pilgrims and the people involved in this "new beginning", the characters of the people and some of the flavor of their hopes and dreams, ideas, work ethic, and humor come to light, and are appreciated by those involved in the study. When their first winter is reflected upon, one can't help but feel the loss of so many loved ones on a personal level. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="22" __label="true"> The resourcefulness and foresight of these religious outcasts helped lay some secure and strong foundations for our country. When they took the time and painstaking effort to write and bring to acceptance the Mayflower Compact, they unknowingly developed the long-lasting concept of freedoms and rights that we Americans enjoy and expect. People tend to develop a much deeper appreciation of these freedoms when they get some hands-on exposure to just exactly what prices have been paid to obtain and protect those freedoms, and it is my goal that this study will help the children develop a solid understanding and appreciation of these principles and ideals. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1"> <span __num="23" __label="true"> As you begin a unit study about Thanksgiving, try to include as many interesting books and activities as possible. Consider writing to the living history museum, Plimoth Plantation, for additional materials and ideas. Their address is Plimoth Plantation, Public Relations Department, P.O. Box 1620, Plymouth, MA 02360. If you cannot visit Plimoth Plantation in person (some of us live a bit FAR to do that!), there is a video that many libraries carry titled: </span> <b> <span __num="24" __label="true"> "Plimoth Plantation: A Visit" </span> </b> <span __num="25" __label="true"> , produced by VideoTours in their History Collection. </span> <br> <img border="0" height="1" src="../images/clear.gif" vspace="2" width="1"> <br> <img border="0" height="1" src="../images/clear.gif" vspace="3" width="1"> <br> <span __num="26" __label="true"> Enjoy this season of giving thanks and bringing the harvest home. There is so much to be thankful for, and as homeschoolers, we have even more to be thankful for -- the chance to really know our children and walk the walk with them, sharing and caring and motivating and learning beside them. Enjoy the adventure, and may you and your family be abundantly blessed! </span> </font> </p> <p align="center"> <a href="../thanksgiving.htm"> <img alt="Thanksgiving Unit Study" border="0" fp-style="fp-btn: Embossed Capsule 3" fp-title="Thanksgiving Unit Study" height="40" id="img1" onmousedown="FP_swapImg(1,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'button12.jpg')" onmouseout="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'button10.jpg')" onmouseover="FP_swapImg(1,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'button11.jpg')" onmouseup="FP_swapImg(0,0,/*id*/'img1',/*url*/'button11.jpg')" src="button10.jpg" width="200"> </a> </p> <p align="center"> <font face="Frutiger Linotype"> <b> <span __num="27" __label="true"> Copyright 2005 Amanda Bennett </span> </b> </font> </p> <p align="center"> <font face="Frutiger Linotype"> <font color="#FF0000"> <b> <font style="font-size: 11pt"> <span __num="28" __label="true"> PLEASE NOTE: </span> </font> </b> </font> <font style="font-size: 11pt"> <span __num="29" __label="true"> This article is copyrighted, and </span> <font color="#FF0000"> <b> <span __num="30" __label="true"> may NOT be used or copied </span> </b> </font> <span __num="31" __label="true"> without written permission of </span> <a href="mailto:amanda@unitstudy.com?subject=Copyright Permission"> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Amanda Bennett </span> </a> <span __num="33" __label="true"> .
