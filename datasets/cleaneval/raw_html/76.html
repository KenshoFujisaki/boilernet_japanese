   <p> <span __num="39" __label="true"> Today, as i am held hostage inside of one of indiana’s many repressive politicalprisons (prisons inside of prison), i am compelled to ask a very critical question incritiquing de situation of de Movement on this front: What has become of de organized andcollective activity that resulted from de sacrifices Comrads Balagoon and Naeem Trotterunselfishly made in 1985 when they rebelled against de racist kkkolonial army at i.s.r.for their acts of brutality against New Afrikans and otha oppressed Peepoe’s? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Is what we are seeing today de outcome of years of resistance by Revolutionaries,progressive north amerikans, and citizens of otha oppressed nations of kolour; years ofbattling neo-kkkolonial forces so We could have better living conditions or to shut downthese political prisons that are designed to carry out low-intensity warfare on those witha radical politic and deny everyone their human rights?! Conditions which were sorepressive and dehumanizing that they compelled Comrad Kataza Taifa to cut of de tip ofhis finger and attempt to mail it to de A.C.L.U. in protest of de barbarism being carriedout at m.c.c. against kaptives? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="41" __label="true"> What has become of those concerned men who marched by de hundreds at i.s.r. in protestof de conditions at m.c.c. and to show solidarity for those being victimized there? Thispeaceful march around de wall at recreation resulted in de entire kkkamp being locked downand dozens of progressive elements being transferred to otha kkkamps thruout de state, butit showed We could come together across race, religions or political lines for a commonpurpose - kombating Our oppression. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Where is de spirit that invoked a group of New Afrikan Freedom Fighters to speak outagainst - what was at that time - de upcoming legal lynching of Comrad Brotha ZiyonYisrayah? These souljahs, Afrika’s glorious children, would later be snatched up byracist pigs and held at gun point while being marched out of i.s.p. on to buses carryingthem to m.c.c. These souljahs would become known as de indiana 10, and later, de indiana6. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="43" __label="true"> There are so many more acts of heroism that could be mentioned here - too numerous toconvey in a brief article such as this. And while i’m well aware that i asked morethan one question, i felt it was necessary in order to show de seriousness of Oursituation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="44" __label="true"> Is de low tide in de prison struggle here in indiana due to de “fact” that Weare nolonger being oppressed or brutalized? Are politically active prisoners nolongerbeing kept in transit or being held on behavior modification units for years and years forno otha reason than Our political views?! Are kaptives nolonger being murdered by prisonofficials?! </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="45" __label="true"> If all of these things are continuing to be perpetuated against Us, then why are Wefailing to organize on a collective and principled protracted level against this madness?i’m not talking about de type of support ones are extending just to get recognitionfrom a particular segment of society so they can parade around as legitimate allies of deoppressed. They engage in de struggle for 30 days, then you don’t hear from them nomore! “Protracted” means on going! Our oppression is protracted, thus Ourresistance too must be protracted! </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="46" __label="true"> Now is definitely not de time to become passive or silent. Kaptives, like Greg Goodwinat i.s.p., are being murdered by prison employees. De state is instituting phone policiesdesigned to further restrict and monitor de communication We have with de outside world.Racist policies such as “Zero Tolerance on Gangs” are being used to terrorizeNew Afrikans - political conscious and kaptured citizens - and strip us of Our so-calledgood-time, and isolate and neutralize Us. Otha oppressive policies include de new drugpolicy which if a kaptive fails a urine test or is caught with any drug or tobaccoparaphernalia, they could loose their visits as well as their so-called good-time.Undoubted this will become a tool used to excommunicate PP’s/POW’s from deoutside world by falsely accusing political activist of drug abuse, or planting thesesubstance in his assigned kkkage by pigs or their stool pigeons. Prisons are beingprivatized and not only are kaptives being forced to work for slave wages, but they arealso being demanded to pay rent!!! </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="47" __label="true"> De main purpose of revisiting de past is so We can critically assess de failures andachievements of those before Us (and de situation five minutes ago for that matter, forit’s all de past), and based upon that knowledge, arrive at a concrete overstandingof Our present conditions and develop concrete solutions for tomorrow. We must buildinside organization and outside prison organization on this indiana plantation that isdesigned to address Our concerns. That will challenge these repressive policies, andindeed de legitimacy of these kkkoncentration kkkamps and de overall system of domination. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> We have to teach this new generation of “rebels” entering de indiana prisonsystem, about de struggles and sacrifices souljahs have made. Teach them about Balagoon,Shaka Shakur, Taifa, Kalonji, and so, so many othas! This will instill in them a greaterappreciation of de culture of Revolutionary Nationalism, and hopefully inspire them intobecome cadre. But remember, We can’t inspire them to do nothing that We AINT doing.Therefore We must move beyond de rhetoric! </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="49" __label="true"> If We fail to pass on de torch to de next generation, We will be singing de same sadsong that de old man sang to de traveler...”they lost their history, so theydied”! And We will have no one to blame but Ourselves. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="56" __label="true"> When i first came to prison, i learned about the struggles and sacrifices that weremade by prisoners, to bring about change, before i even arrived. While in prison i havemet, and participated with, the prisoners who continue to struggle and sacrifice forchange. Over the years there have been positive changes. However, with every positivechange, the DOC does that much more to make things worst. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="57" __label="true"> There is much change that still needs to be made. That means there is still muchstruggle and sacrifice ahead. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="58" __label="true"> We all know that prisons are one of many battlefields in the larger struggle for truefreedom. We prisoners can struggle each and every moment, but the fact remains we cannotdo it alone. We have to have outside support - and this support must be continuous. True,we have some support, but, let’s be honest - it is not as it should be, nor are thevarious supporters united as they should be. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="59" __label="true"> The prisoners, as well as the supporters, need to put aside the petty differences thatare keeping us divided - thus, not allowing a result of continuous change for the better.Let us not fool ourselves, we are being watched. We prisoners know how we are beingwatched - and the support groups/individuals are also being watched, be it over theInternet or through various other COINTELPRO methods. They are sitting back and saying,“they cannot even unite amongst themselves, so what do we have to fear of them?” </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="60" __label="true"> When M.C.C., in Westville, IN, first opened, prisoners were beaten, chained to beds,gassed, etc. because of their striving to make a difference. There was a little bit ofunorganized outside support. Many of these were newly formed groups that came to bebecause of M.C.C., many of the “big”, well known, groups were not really (betterread truly) interested in being involved. However, when prisoners started starvingthemselves and a prisoner cut off his finger tip, and M.C.C. started getting nationalmedia attention - then all kind of groups wanted to support the prisoners. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Does all of that have to happen again, before the prisoners on the G.-A.S., S.H.U. andvarious other control units, get the support - a unified support - they deserve? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="62" __label="true"> Right now i happen to be on the G.-A.S. unit, and much needs to be done for theprisoners on the unit. So, i will speak about that. We are not allowed to take the G.E.D.or get substance abuse and anger management help. These are things prisoners must have toregain “lost good time” or receive even a chance of a sentence reduction incourt. The prisoners receive bogus conduct reports, are harassed by the guards and deniedmost of the rights we are supposed to have. For example: We are supposed to have one hourof recreation daily, but most times we only get 20-45 minutes (usually 20-30 mins.). Itdepends on which guards are working that day. They literally tell you, “so what, filea grievance.” Most grievances are never returned or ruled on! We’ve even had aguard go so far as to tell us, “we use the grievances to wipe our asses with.”(Well... if so, i hope they get some paper cuts on their rearend and the ink causes aninfection). i could go on and on about the things occurring on this unit, but it wouldtake up pages of this newsletter, so i will move on. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="63" __label="true"> Beatings of prisoners by guards is a major and growing problem throughout the state ofIndiana, especially on the control units of SHU, NSB, DS, MSU, MCC and D-cell house. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="64" __label="true"> Many of the prisoners being beaten are the mentally ill and political prisoners (manyare harassed and singled out for physical assault because of their filing complaints andlitigation against prison officials and guards). Our lives here in Indiana DOC are notsafe due to the extreme conditions and the possibility of brutality we must face daily. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> We are fed up with this injustice. Are you? We call upon you, the people, to be realwith us and with yourselves. Please contact the prisoners who write in this newsletter formore detailed info about what is occurring on the units they live in. Continuously contactthe elected legislative members, the governor, members of the news media and the IndianaDOC and let them know that you are aware of the gross lack of regard for our rights ashuman beings - and that you will not stand for it (then, once you do this, please do notstand for it!) Help us expose the wrongs, the conditions, the racism and the brutalityagainst prisoners in the Indiana DOC - and demand that an independent investigation isinitiated into the beatings and assaults (past and present) of prisoners by guards (i knowof these personally, i have the scars to show it does occur). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> We call upon you to assist and help us now - not after a prisoner has been resorted tostarving himself, cutting off a finger (or been beaten to death by guards, which willoccur eventually - again), because they need your assistance. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="67" __label="true"> We prisoners continue to look back at yesterday - and seeing tomorrow. What do we donext? Please support prisoners. We can only do so much - without you! </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="88" __label="true"> It’s been (50) years since the U.S has went to Europe + butchered other Europeans(note: the last being nazi-occupied Germany). Ironically the U.S. got involved in worldwar II for the same reason why they’ve gotten involved with Kosovo. It was O.K. forthe demon Hitler to hit neighboring fronts like Poland, Denmark, Italy and even France.But, once he’d started to hit Britain with “fly-by’s” it had become awhole other story. it was O.K. for Hitler’s government to butcher millions ofso-called “undesirables” in Germany while still trading with the U.S dictators.But, once he’d began to bomb + butcher Britain/England, again, it had become a wholeother story. The U.S. felt that it’s mad-brother Hitler had made a violatable move bypounding on the “mother land” of the pirates, pilgrims, + settlers who’dstolen the land from the natives 400-odd years ago in what’s now called“America”. These “outcasts” were considered the scum of England, yetit didn’t take away the fact that the average Euro-settler in the U.S. is a directdescendant of England/Britain. Thus; Hitler had violated by “slapping” the U.S.dictators mother (i.e. Britain/England). Thus; he had to be dealt with and he was. Besidesthis; the U.S. felt that there was no room for two world rulers. So, again; he had to bedealt with. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="89" __label="true"> Now; in 1999 we have “Milosevic”. An individual who’s all for taking outany ethnic group in his region who’s either of Turkish descent, Islamic in way oflife, or both. Using the invasion of the Turkish (Turkey) Empire hundreds of years ago ashis excuse for butchering not only the men, but babies, women, + elders. Three of the mostvulnerable targets in any war. Giving his troops the O.K. to cross over to neighboringregions + taking over. Sounds familiar? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="90" __label="true"> The U.S. got involved not because it cared about the refugees. For over (4) years theU.S. government ignored the butchering of refugees in that region by Milosovic. Question:Since when has the U.S government cared about Muslims being butchered? Answer: Never! So,why now? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="91" __label="true"> Because the massacre had gotten too wide spread + other parts of Europe were beginningto receive some “disturbing” news about Kosovo. This was bound to “leakout” due to how even the most poorest regions in Europe were/are allowed to plug intothe media satellites that’s governed by the U.S. + Britain. Unlike regions of colorwho are barely allowed to plug into such media-satellites, let alone launch their ownmedia-satellites into space. The U.S had begun to see that slowly but surelyMilosevic’s government was moving closer + closer towards other European regions.Thus; causing more than just “local” strife in that region. The so-calledpresident/representative of the U.S. had made it clear during his national address on theday before he’s given his trained butchers/military the O.K. to launch a bombingcampaign on Kosovo, that the U.S. was concerned about an “united Europe” + thatMilosevic was dividing the Europeans house. Now let’s try to draw out some wisdomfrom these words. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="92" __label="true"> For the past (50) years Europe as a whole has been “major conflict” free.Until recently with the kontradiction in Bosnia &amp; Kosovo. For the past (50) years theU.S., Britain, Germany, France, + Russia have been fueling internal conflicts in regionsof color (i.e. Korea, Afrika, Mexico, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Palestine, Iraq, Iran,Kuba, Peru, Hawaii, Japan, China, etc.). Causing brother/sister to turn on their ownimage/people. Dismantling whole tribes in the rain forests. Slave labor in Indonesia.Forced sterilization of women of color or they’ll receive no work in the NIKEfactories, etc. Causing mischief from one corner of our planet to the next. While most ofEurope felt + acted like it was “safe” + war free. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="93" __label="true"> Now that Milosevic’s tested his long arm tactic, threatening the“stableness” of Europe; he must be dealt with. Because it’s hard (too hard)for the U.S. &amp; Britain in particular to focus both on dictating + causing mischief inregions of color while their foreparents lands (Europe) dismantling. This is too much forthe mischief makers (i.e. U.S., Britain, France, etc.)... </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="94" __label="true"> So now we’ve got reactionary nations dropping bombs + guiding/misguiding missilesall over Europe (note: while still doing fly-by’s daily on Iraq). As of today (June13, 1999) Nato ground butchers are marching thru Kosovo. This is a part of the so-calledcease fire agreement that Milosevic supposedly agreed to. Already Serb troops haveexchanged fire with Nato ground troops. And Russia’s ground troops have been accusedof blocking off the Nato troops with their tanks. Question: When was the last time U.S.military troops have met “face to face” on the battle field with Russia’sarmy? Answer: Never! Both nations are used to supplying other regions with weapons tofight in their name. But never have the (2) actually met face to face on a battle field.Finally “the eagle meets the bear”. This so-called “agreement” is justthe next stage that’s being set for yet some more kontradictions. Those of you whoare taking a deep sigh of relief due to the so-called agreement, don’t become toolaxed. Because we’re dealing with masters of tricknometry. The smoking glass + mirrorillusionists. The now you see it, now you don’t masters. David Copperfield’s amere baby to what we’re dealing with. But, sign’s and symbol’s are for theconscious/aware mind. For the nodder/sleeper will surely miss the mark. Just a thought. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="141" __label="true"> February 15, 1999 Soon the Indiana legislatures will go into session. A bill has beenprepared for introduction regarding prisoner mail. This legislation is equally importantfor the "free', citizen with whom the prisoner corresponds. The plan is to bring intofruition law that will permit unimpeded searches, confiscations and copying of outgoingand incoming prisoner mail, with the previously available "requisite" dueprocess no longer being applicable. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="142" __label="true"> It must be understood that the rights (limited though they are) prisoners enjoyregarding mail are also rights guaranteed to those "free" citizens that wecorrespond with. These rights are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United StatesConstitution and made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to thatdocument. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="143" __label="true"> It must be further understood that these Constitutional Amendments govern this matter.The state is in effect attempting to circumvent these federal protections and arbitrarilysuperimpose state laws. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="144" __label="true"> The matter regarding prisoners’ First Amendment rights is well established. TheUnited States Supreme Court has addressed this topic since 1974 and these decisions arethe landmarks by which the states must set their policies and regulations. The statecannot make any laws that “legally" take precedent over these federal rulings. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="145" __label="true"> Those of us prepared to challenge this boldness by the state of Indiana need only armourselves with the federal authorities which clearly support our position and then let thechips fall where they may. </span> </p>

   <p> <strong> <span __num="153" __label="true"> A </span> </strong> <span __num="154" __label="true"> . The First Amendment Claim </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="155" __label="true"> The wellspring of First Amendment law regarding prisoners' legal mail can be found in a1974 United States Supreme Court decision (Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 94 S.Ct.1800 (1974)). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="156" __label="true"> In this case, the court upheld censorship of prisoners, mail if two criteria were met: </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="157" __label="true"> First, the practice in question must further an important and substantial interest </span> <u> <span __num="158" __label="true"> unrelatedto the suppression of expression </span> </u> <span __num="159" __label="true"> . Prison officials must show that a regulationauthorizing mail censorship furthers one or more of the substantial governmental interestsof security, order and rehabilitation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> Second, the limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessaryor essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved, i.e.security, order and rehabilitation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="161" __label="true"> The case of Martinez was construed and applied again in 1979. (Bell v. Wolfish, 441fU.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979)). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="162" __label="true"> In this case the court approved a "publishers only" rule that prohibitedprisoners from receiving hardcover books from any source other than publishers, bookclubs, and book stores. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="163" __label="true"> Eight years later, 1987, the Supreme Court considered Martinez again. (Turner v.Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987)). </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="164" __label="true"> In this case, the court held that a prison regulation that impinges on prisoners,rights is valid if it is "reasonably related to legitimate penologicalinterests". </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="165" __label="true"> The court backed off the language in Martinez, the Turner court listed four factors bywhich to assess a regulation's reasonableness: 1) the existence of a valid, rationalconnection between the regulation and the interest used to justify it; 2) the existence ofother methods by which prisoners can exercise the asserted right; 3) the impact onprisoners, and prison resources in general, if the right is accommodated; and 4) theabsence of ready alternatives to the regulation. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="166" __label="true"> The Supreme Court again returned to the topic of prisoner correspondence in 1989.(Thornburgh v. Abbott, 49 U.S. 413, 19 S.Ct. 1874 (1989)). This was, in short, a return to1974 and Martinez. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="167" __label="true"> This court carefully noted that Martinez did not announce a "least restrictivemeans" test for prisoner mail, but the analytical point most significant to theMartinez decision was that the earlier delision had dealt with outgoing mail, while </span> <u> <span __num="168" __label="true"> Thornburghinvolved incoming mail </span> </u> <span __num="169" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="170" __label="true"> With regard to outgoing mail, the court observed: "Dangerous outgoingcorrespondence is more likely to fall within readily identifiable categories: examplesnoted in Martinez include escape plans, plans relating to ongoing criminal activity, andthreats of blackmail or extortion." </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="171" __label="true"> The court then seemed to reestablish the Martinez standard for outgoing mail whilelimiting the Turner Standard (1987), to incoming mail. The court makes this clear whenthey write, "As we do not here apply the Martinez Standard,"; the implication isthat the earlier standard, as now clarified, </span> <u> <span __num="172" __label="true"> does not apply in cases of incoming mailsuch as Turner, but still retains vitality. That vitality can only be with reference tooutgoing mail. </span> </u> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="173" __label="true"> Still, the standard for assessing interference with prisoners' outgoing mail is notentirely clear (e.g. United States v. Workman, 80 f.3d 688, 698-99 (2nd. Cir. 1996)).("Where good cause is shown, outgoing mail can be read without violating prisoners'First Amendment rights", noting that "Turner ... is considerably moredeferential to restraints imposed by prison officials on prisoner rights than the standardof Martinez") </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="174" __label="true"> B </span> </strong> <span __num="175" __label="true"> . The Due Process Claim </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="176" __label="true"> The United States Supreme Court dealt with this topic in 1981 and again in 1984. Thecourt made the Constitutional protections clear (Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 101 S.Ct.1908 (1981) and Hudson v. Paimer, 468 U.S. 517, 531, 104 S. et. 3194, 3203 (1984)). Thecourt held: </span> </p> 
   <p align="center"> <span __num="177" __label="true"> The Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when astate employee deprives an individual of property, without making available a meaningfulpost deprivation remedy. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="180" __label="true"> Today just as was the case thirty years ago when the Black Panther Party first emerged,the New African (Black) communities remain colonized communities that are controlled fromthe outside by the capitalist bourgeoisie who in turn use New Afrikan (Black)collaborators, petit-bourgeoisie, opportunists, and domestic neo-colonialists to controlthe communities from the inside with their pacification programs designed to mislead theoppressed in the interest of imperialist hegemony. These imperialist lackies, reformists,and revisionists are enemies of the oppressed masses and must be stopped at all costs andby any means necessary in order for the colonized and exploited masses to break the chainsof neo-slavery. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="181" __label="true"> But first and foremost in the New Afrikan (Black) liberation struggle, the lumpen andlumpen proletariat must break with parasitism, but they are not alone. There are manyconscious revolutionaries and those proclaiming leadership and elitism that must alsobreak from the chains of parasitism, which means disunity with any and everyone thatcan't, won't, or refuse to break with parasitism, and this too must be done by any meansnecessary. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="182" __label="true"> In the struggle for national and international liberation, there is no room for theelitist mentality. There are no big I's and little u's. There is no better than the next.There is only conscious, quasi-conscious, and unconscious. There is only teacher andstudent (and we are all both teacher and student). There is only the revolutionary andcounter-revolutionary. In the struggle for national and international liberation, we areall oppressed and colonized people just the same, and as lumpen and lumpen proletariat wehave a common enemy in capitalism, imperialism, fascism, zionism, racism, exploitation,genocide, and oppression (i.e. class, race, sex. gender, and religion). So how can anyonehave an elitist mentality? Only those chained to parasitism entertain or consider thethought of the elitist mentality, which goes to make any such person no more thanopportunist and counter-revolutionary. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="183" __label="true"> As we draw nearer to the year 2000 and the next millennium in the struggle for nationaland international liberation and self-determination, the oppressed and ex- ploited masseswithin the colonized communities of imperialist amerikkka are continuously beingterrorized, brutalized, and murdered daily by the fascist, patrolling, colonialoccupational personnel (cops) and racists. The capitalist bourgeoisie still control thepolitics and economics of our communities by way of the New Afrikan (Black) collaborators,petit-bourgeoisie, opportunists, and domestic neo-colonialists who serve the interests ofthe racist, exploiting, and imperialistic cliques of settleristic America. ThisEuro-Amerikan settleristic nation of amerikkka is the foundation and home base ofcapitalism and imperialism, and leads the world in acts of terrorism, exploitation, andgenocide, and must be smashed by whatever means necessary. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="184" __label="true"> The lumpen and lumpen proletariat of the colonized conscious left, by being colonizedwithin the belly of capitalism and imperialism, are in the best of strategic positions,more than any of the world's people, to strike a crucial and shattering blow to the veryheart and soul of capitalism and imperialism. As long as capitalism and imperialism areallowed to go unchecked from within its amerikkkan base, it continues getting stronger asit conquers more of the world's territory and practices genocide on more of the world'speople, while those of the conscious left within the very borders of imperialist amerikkawatch it carry out its policies of massive de- struction. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="185" __label="true"> It is long past time to stop fooling ourselves and prolonging the ineluctableconclusion. It's clear that the liberation struggle is a protracted struggle, but it'salso clear that the New Afrikan (Black) liberation struggle has been going on since thefirst slave was kidnapped. And as we engage in our over-extended, protracted struggle, we,as a New Afrikan (Black) people, are being imprisoned and placed on death rows by thethousands and murdered in our homes and in the streets of imperialist amerikkka. The timehas come to intensify the national an international liberation struggle within the bordersof imperialist settleristic amerikkka. What the Panthers do more than anything else isthey set a standard that young black people particularly want to measure up to--It's astandard of ag- gressiveness, of militance, of just forcefulness, the sort of standard wehaven't had in the past. Our idols have been Dr. King who, for all of his beauty as a manwas not an aggressive man, but the Panthers and I think Malcolm X, have set this new kindof standard that a great many people want to adhere to. ~ Julian Bond, April 1970 </span> </p>

The wardens andbusiness administrators at each prison shall be held in strict accounting for all moneyheld in trust for a prisoner. I.C. 4-24-6-1 et seq.

   <p> <span __num="228" __label="true"> We are confronted with so much difficulty within the course of Our daily lives that thesimple act of living is becoming a real chore. I use to wonder why some people would praywhen confronted with various difficult situations because i know that there can never beany substitute for concrete struggles in its many manifestations. But when i realized thatsome of Us are not praying for some god’s intervention into Our social realities, butthat they are praying for the strength and courage to struggle on because at moments inOur lives Our conditions become almost unbearable. Our systematic oppression, repression,deprivation, and the colonial violence that We experience daily has effected the veryfiber of Our being. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="229" __label="true"> Some of you may think that We are powerless to make a change and “to you” isay that you don’t know your own strength. That power that We truly possess if We canget past all of Our petty differences and develop a love and concern for each othernationally as We collectively confront Our national crisis. And some of you may indeedbelieve that it is going to take a miracle to get past all of Our internal differences todo this work together. But all it will truly take is the personal commitment of each oneof Us to make this change and unite in common struggle. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="230" __label="true"> The miracle of change exists in each one of Us and all We have to do is realize Our ownpotential and work together instead of continuing to destroy Us all with Our individualdisplays of savagery. We have to rise above all this madness because it’s a new day. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="235" __label="true"> Why would one species need the milk of another species? Cows drink cow’s milk,goats drink goat’s milk, dogs drink dog’s milk. So, shouldn’t human beingsdrink human being milk? That would seem more logical than humans drinking cow’s milkor goat’s milk. How common is it for a lion to drink milk from a female zebra?It’s just not within its nature to do so. Picture a human being being breast feedingor being breast fed by a cow or goat. How silly does that seem? How many full grownanimals (e.g. bears, dogs, deer, lions, mooses, cows) do you know of that drink milk? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="236" __label="true"> Once we are weaned from the nipple there is no need for us to continue drinking ourmother’s breast milk. If there was a need for humans to drink milk after we reach acertain age then don’t you think human milk would be sold in gallon jugs at ourneighborhood grocery stores? Let’s use some common sense for a moment.... When achild is born its little bones aren’t quite strong enough. This is why it is unableto stand on its own or hold certain object of weight. This is also why the child must bebreast fed by its mother to receive the calcium it needs for stronger bones anddevelopment. Once the child reach 10-12 months old, its bones are usually strong enough tosupport its body weight, walk, and hold heavier objects, thus the child soon out grows theneed to be breast fed. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="237" __label="true"> Some babies are fed animal’s milk instead of its own mother’s natural milk.Similac, and infantmeal are milk like formulas that are fed to new born babies as asubstitution for its mother’s breast milk. The child is usually fed these kinds offormulas for a short time before being switched to cow’s milk. This cow’s milkis consumed from childhood to adulthood without the realization that it isn’t neededfor our growth and development anymore, not to mention the fact that it’s not forhuman consumption period. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="238" __label="true"> We see milk commercials and billboard signs advertising milk from cows as if itsnatural for human beings to drink. A common phrase that we see and hear is, “Gotmilk?” or “Drink milk, it does a body good”. But how could it do the bodygood when it’s a known cause for colon cancer, more common amongst black people. Ithas a number of ill effects on the digestive system such as, stomach bloating, excessivegas, intestinal complications, bowel disfunctions, constipation and of course the listgoes on. But let the farm industries tell it, it’s all good for us to consume thisproduct. It’s all about the almighty dollar in this country and for the profit makers(capitalist) it matters not who’s health is effected later on in life by it. To thefarm industries, it all make sense. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="239" __label="true"> Let’s be real about this. I mean, how can something be both good and bad at thesame time for our bodies? What sense does it make to have “strong bones” yet, onthe other hand have serious digestive and intestinal complications which can and oftentimes will lead to colon cancer? It just doesn’t add up. But of course it does (addup $$$$$$$) for the capitalist farmers of this country. It’s not beyond belief thatif women could produce milk like cows and goats, her milk would be sold in cartons andgallon jugs at the corner grocery stores. Now imagine that.... </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="247" __label="true"> The normal and prevalent belief is that we, homosepiens, the human species, are at thetop of the food chain. This can hardly be disputed. It is also a well established beliefthat we are of a higher intelligence than all other forms of life and given dominion overall other species by God himself. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="248" __label="true"> Our “will” is thought to be for the most part independent as opposed to beinga result of socialization. The common belief among the populous (mostly ignorant to eventhe basics of psychology) and even some social scientists is that even though environmentplays a significant role in determining a person’s personality, character, morals,values, ethics, etc., that which will prevail over social indoctrinations is“independent will”. I’m sure you’ve heard many times statements to theeffect of, “I understand he had a childhood of abuse, drugs, violence, poverty, etc.,but he knew right from wrong, and he ‘chose’ to do wrong”. These arestatements often made by prosecutors, victims and their families. You can even hear thissentiment voiced among those on the flip side of this equation - prisoners themselves. Youalso hear, “I came up in the ghetto, too, but ‘I’ didn’t turn to drugsand crime.” Well, I respect their honesty if that’s indeed what it is, but it isderived from ignorance; ignorance of the dynamics of the mind; ignorance of human nature. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="249" __label="true"> Morals, values, and ethics, relatively, are not passed on through genes and are not apart of our “mental wiring”. However, mental wiring does play a part in howsharp or dull we are in perception and cognition. Genetics and the quality of prenatalcare can determine to a large degree the efficiency of our brain and nervous system, i.e.,whether we perceive slowly or quickly; our ability to decipher and remember information;whether we have a dull character or an erratic, hyper character. All these things can bedetermined by the structure of our brain and nervous system and also by brain chemistry.These factors are for the most part independent of direct socialization, but they do notdetermine morals, values, and ethics. These are determined by socialization, i.e., family,home upbringing, community, school, media, church, traumatic experiences, etc.; all thatenters the brain by way of the five senses. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="250" __label="true"> The mind is an extremely complex entity. Though we seem to live according to ourconscious decisions, the subconscious mind is what dictates to our conscious mind, and thesubconscious mind is constructed second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour, day byday, year by year from the “intake” of outside stimuli via the five senses. Theoverwhelming majority of information that we absorb we absorb subconsciously (withoutbeing aware of it), nevertheless it is absorbed and becomes a part of our subconsciousinfluencing our emotions, values, ethics, etc., hence, our conscious decisions. Takeethics in particular; the standard of what is right and just as distinct from wrong andevil. One may well know that certain activities are wrong “according to the law andthe mainstream moral standards”, but in his/her “own community and culture”these activities are prevalent and accepted practices, and eventhough one knows that theyare illegal and immoral, because of the manner in which they are portrayed, consciouslyand subliminally, the propensity for one to partake in these activities is much greater.There are many variations, and one rule doesn’t apply to each and every individualsituation, but the only way you can miss my point is to be mentally deficient or either inextreme denial. Given different circumstances and a different upbringing, you could verywell be just like the person you despise the most. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="251" __label="true"> For the sake of argument, let’s say that everyone does have an independent will.How then could you explain ones choosing to do wrong? Either they are bad by nurture orthey are bad by nature. It’s as simple as that. There’s no other alternative orexplanation. The opponents of my theory would have to argue that it is nature, becausethey are opposed to the theory of nurture (socialization) as a cause of one being bad,evil, a social menace, etc. Now, if a person is bad by nature as opposed to nurture, howcan they be held accountable for their bad conduct? Think critically before attempting toanswer this question if you’ve never ventured on these grounds before. If a person isindeed a bad or evil person, I personally do not believe that it is by nature. I stand onthe theory of socialization. This is not a crutch, an excuse, a scapegoat, etc.; it’sa fact. No doubt, many misuse and abuse this theory as a scapegoat to further theirpersonal interest taking away from the legitimacy of the argument when presented underserious circumstances. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="252" __label="true"> To put this issue of psychology into a political, revolutionary perspective, let mebegin by stating that psychology is an integralcomponent of politics, revolutionarypolitics in particular. Governmental policy (politics) influences social norms andculture, and social norms and culture in turn influence governmental policy, but theformer is the primary focus. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="253" __label="true"> Today in the U.S. we see the fanatical religious, right-wing blaming the so-calledliberals for the country’s moral decay. In particular “Newt” blamed theliberals for the mass murder committed by the two teens at Columbine Highschool inColorado. On the one hand these hypocrites condemn “big government” especiallywhen it interferes with big business, but on the other hand they seek to repress andcontrol every aspect of our personal lives. They seek to set the standards for properfamily structure, family values, education, religion, responsible media, correctconstitutional interpretation, etc. and condemn all other opinions. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="254" __label="true"> The same restrictions of personal freedoms that are in practice now in this country arethe same restrictions of personal freedoms that this government was condemning so-calledcommunist and socialist countries for ten, twenty, thirty years ago. Only here,they’re called “social contracts”, i.e. anti-crime laws, war on drugs, gunsafety and control, etc. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="255" __label="true"> The U.S supreme court recently ruled that it was unconstitutional to prohibit“citizens” from hanging out on the streets simply because they appeared to begang members. This has been in practice in Chicago since the early 90s. Eventhough it wasruled unconstitutional, you can believe they’ll come up with something just asrepressive if not more so. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="256" __label="true"> As for their laissez faire (hands off big business) policy, you can bet that it’snot for the purpose of promoting equality in the free market. It is exclusively for thepurpose of furthering the accumulation of wealth into the hands of a few - monopolycapitalism. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="257" __label="true"> The populous are blind to these facts, and even worse, many wouldn’t really care agreat deal if they knew the reality of it all. The social institutions, i.e. media,educational system, religion, entertainment, etc. shape our ethics, values, etc. more nowthan ever, because they are becoming more and more intrusive into our personal lives. Manysay you can’t legislate morals. I say that legislation impacts social institutions,and social institutions impact morals, but no amount of legislation can overwhelm orcorrect the effects of capitalism that have degraded all that is spiritually sound andlife loving. It takes revolution. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="258" __label="true"> As I stated before, governmental policy, or lack there of, can influence social normsand culture. For instance, the government’s economic policy of laissez faire(allowing the market to proceed with little or no anti-trust protection) inevitably leadsto the accumulation of the overwhelming majority of wealth and power into the hands of asmall power elite and an ever increasing poverty class of despair creating a culture ofcrime, violence, drugs, cut-throat individualism, ignorance, etc. The government’spolicy of refusing to prosecute clear cut cases of police brutality and corruption createsa sentiment towards the C.O.P. (colonial occupational personnel) and the state ofuntrustworthiness and vindictiveness to say the least, especially among poor people andpeople of color while in turn creating a sentiment towards the cops and state among theupper class and most whites of patriotic protectors. The government’s policy ofmisrepresenting history, especially in the academic and religious fields contributes tothe cultural perception of white superiority and black inferiority. The governmentalpolicies that give less opportunities to females, mainly economic opportunities,automatically reinforces the already established culture of sexism, female subservienceand inferiority - patriarchy. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="259" __label="true"> Each of these examples is a part of the U.S. capitalist culture in large part as aresult of governmental policy. These are major yet general examples, however the same“cause and effect” principle applies to individual situations, but are connectedto the general culture. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="260" __label="true"> It’s been said quite frequently that prisons are microcosms of that society atlarge. The highest rates per capita of crime, murder in particular, suicide, imprisonmentare in the U.S., and it is the only developed, industrialized nation in the world thatstill has the death penalty, yet it is called the greatest democracy in the world. Well,let me say this: A democracy is only as strong as the people’s level of politicalconsciousness. The people (proletariat) can not truly dictate if they do not trulyoverstand the science of society, politics and economics. They can only be dictatees;pawns in the game of the power elite, voting for illusions. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="261" __label="true"> You ask, “how does all this relate to the title?” An unconscious person makesdecisions from a subjective will that is controlled by those in control of that particularenvironment. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="262" __label="true"> The following is an analogy stated quite proficiently by Mr. Hoover: </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="263" __label="true"> “Having a subjective will is like being in someone else’s dream. A dream inwhich you have no power to create the scenes or change them. Let’s imagine that thedream is about life and the dreamer is able to make the laws and change the laws or he canmake ‘new laws’ to hold you in check if you begin to win in his game of life. Hecould make you rich and famous or he could make you a wino, drug addict or a criminal(according to his law). In his dream, you are used to his ends. Your actions would only bereactions that he could control, calculate and predict and when he has no more use foryou, he could eliminate you from his dream. Or he may just decide to store you away insome sort of ‘warehouse’ for his future use. Or perhaps he will supply you withdrugs and guns and let you smoke and shoot your way out of existence.” From the BluePrint </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="264" __label="true"> In order for capitalism or any other type of repressive, corrupt system to persist andthrive, the mass majority of the people must be of a subjective will. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="265" __label="true"> As I stated earlier, a democracy is only as strong as the people’s level ofconsciousness. Democracy is synonymous with socialism, and in order for true socialism toexist, the people must be of an objective will which entails being conscious ofsociety/environment and its ability to indoctrinate so they won’t be subject to thatindoctrination. An objective will also entails the ability to shape the environment asopposed to being shaped by the environment. Now you may ask, “why would I worry aboutbeing negatively indoctrinated if the system is socialist?” The answer: Eventhough asystem may be socialist, in the interest of the populous, there is always a latent forcelurking internally and/or externally seeking to overthrow the status quo. There arecontradictions to everything. This is the law of dialectics. Hence, what is necessary tokeep the forces of capitalism and other corrupt systems from overcoming socialism is notonly a conscious people but a system that systematically instills consciousness in thepeople via the social institutions, i.e. education, religion, entertainment, etc. This isrevolutionary scientific socialism. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="266" __label="true"> You can not disconnect an individual’s actions and thoughts from the society andculture at large, and you can not disconnect culture and society at large fromgovernmental policy. What may appear to be an isolated incident may very well soon becomean epidemic; hence know this: A people’s collective will is a direct result of thetype of system under which those people live. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="267" __label="true"> True socialism - the objective will of a conscious people - is what we struggle for. </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="276" __label="true"> Introduction: </span> <br> <span __num="277" __label="true"> This interview is given by: Rasuual Byrd-Bey. I will be interviewing my brotha manOlugbala Pili.Suggs, on the matters of what one must have to consider their self. Ascientist, one who is conscious in deeds.. </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="278" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="279" __label="true"> Brotha Olugbala, first let me say that there are some who will not be in agreement withsome of your information; that will be spoken on in this interview. </span> <br> <span __num="280" __label="true"> What do you think of such? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="281" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="282" __label="true"> Well, we know that the Moorish Holy Koran explains this answer best. </span> <br> <span __num="283" __label="true"> The lips of the wise are as the doors of a cabinet no sooner are they opened, buttreasures are poured out before thee! </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="284" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="285" __label="true"> My brotha man you answer well. </span> <br> <span __num="286" __label="true"> So could you now tell me and others who may not know, but call ourselves scientists whatscience is? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="287" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="288" __label="true"> Science is a system. It is a word taken from Latin, meaning “to know” that whichwe use for knowledge, that we have collected and interpreted in a certain systematic way.We also use the word for the process of collection and interpretation, so that a“scientist” is one who bring a formula of science; with the observation ofunexplained facts </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="289" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="290" __label="true"> So, as the observer studies the observations what does he see? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="291" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="292" __label="true"> He sees interrelationships and patterns, but she generalizes a pattern to cover unobservedfacts, and he devises a tentative explanation of the pattern. A “Hypothesis.” </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="293" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="294" __label="true"> What does one do with this hypothesis you speak on? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="295" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="296" __label="true"> One then test the hypothesis on new observations with a planned experiment. And if theexperiment fails to confirm the hypothesis, the observers must formulate a new hypothesisand conduct another experiment. If that experiment does confirm the hypothesis; then thehypothesis becomes a part of the observer’s collection of “knowledge”.Through repeated conformations along with success in helping to explain new observationspromotes a hypothesis to the highest level of facts, principle, law and theory; </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="297" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="298" __label="true"> Could you also tell me and the other readers about one (1) crucial part of the scientificmethod? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="299" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="300" __label="true"> One (1) crucial part of the scientific method is (“caution”)researchers-”seeker” go to great pain to avoid the many kinds of error and bias(encouraging one outcome or answer over the other) that can contaminate experiments. Weconduct controlled experiments (where everything is the same except the variable beingtested) to be sure that the results we see are “real” and not unforeseen effectsof our experimental setups: Further we must analyze these results with statistics. </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="301" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="302" __label="true"> Could you explain to me and others about another essential part of the method? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="303" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="304" __label="true"> Another essential part of the method is “communication”, the greater parts onour list. However, observation, generalization, hypothesis, and experiment are all uselessif they are kept secret; let’s take a look into this by saying, a result is not aresult -- it has no validity, no (credibility gap) -- if other scientist cannot obtain thesame result. As scientists we are sure you can fill in the blanks as words were left out;Thus the scientist must write and publish scientific reports that explain observations,generalization, hypothesis, and experiments in detail so that others who seek can repeatthe work. </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="305" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="306" __label="true"> Okay now, tell us what science is firmly based on? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="307" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="308" __label="true"> Well, science is firmly based on the notion of repeatability; it has little room for theunique and for those who keep their methods or findings secret, and even less room forthese individuals who manufacture false observations and experimental results. Becausethis demand for repeatability means that every step of a scientist’s work must becheckable; science possesses an accountability and duty, a dedication to truth, accuracy,and completeness that surpasses all other allegiances. </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="309" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="310" __label="true"> Out of all that you have covered could you tell us what the “attributes” of ascientist is? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="311" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="312" __label="true"> As a scientist your “attributes” are as important as all other formulas. ascientist seek knowledge, truth, and “human survival”. Using the scientificmethod, potential scientist need the ability to work and think methodically; we shouldalso have other traits because scientist in “general” are persistent, curious,precise, intelligent, objective, honest, enthusiastic, and humble; (if their hypothesis isconfirmed right the first time.) </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="313" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="314" __label="true"> Well, brotha Olugbala we will wrap this interview up shortly, but let me say that it hasbeen a tremendous blessing for myself to hear a lesson being taught... Nevertheless, Ihave two (2) final questions for you. How did you receive this chemistry that givesvaluable information? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="315" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="316" __label="true"> I received this formula through cronyism = which means favoritism shown to old friendswithout regard for their qualifications. My good brotha-man Frank James-Bey, whom I honorfull-heartily, taught me much. So this I attained from him; and through years of study. </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="317" __label="true"> Byrd-Bey: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="318" __label="true"> Okay, we are now at the close of this interview, is there any good measure of last wordsthat you would like to say? </span> </p> 
   <p> <strong> <span __num="319" __label="true"> Olugbala: </span> </strong> <br> <span __num="320" __label="true"> Yes there is my brotha-man. I emphasize this for the conscious ones, we must now go beyondelementary, we’re scientists the formula has been mixed with favorable“attributes” it’s time to confirm that we can be as valuable as any otherculture of people. Learn that the advantages lieth not in possessing good things, but inthe knowing “to” use them. Think about this for years to come! </span> </p>

   <p> <span __num="332" __label="true"> With your hand on the trigger, do you feel bigger? </span> <br> <span __num="333" __label="true"> Like you’ve got the world in your hands, </span> <br> <span __num="334" __label="true"> you walk erect, with a “S” on your chest, looking </span> <br> <span __num="335" __label="true"> to shoot another human being. </span> <br> <span __num="336" __label="true"> You’ll shoot a little boy, or girl, woman or man, </span> <br> <span __num="337" __label="true"> it don’t matter, as long as you hear the clatter </span> <br> <span __num="338" __label="true"> of your gun go boom. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="339" __label="true"> Now you’ve taken the life of someone’s wife, </span> <br> <span __num="340" __label="true"> husband, sister, or brother. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="341" __label="true"> Now how would you feel if for a thrill someone </span> <br> <span __num="342" __label="true"> killed your mother?, Father?, Sister?, Brother?, </span> <br> <span __num="343" __label="true"> or child? </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="344" __label="true"> I know, you’ll put your hand on the trigger and </span> <br> <span __num="345" __label="true"> go buck wild! </span> <br> <span __num="346" __label="true"> Some will call the cops, so they can cock their </span> <br> <span __num="347" __label="true"> blocks to shoot the perpetrator down. </span> <br> <span __num="348" __label="true"> Either way that’s another souljah that wont be </span> <br> <span __num="349" __label="true"> around. </span> <br> <span __num="350" __label="true"> Body count, two souljahs down, </span> <br> <span __num="351" __label="true"> since they killed one of yours, you killed one </span> <br> <span __num="352" __label="true"> of theirs, now neither one of you is around. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="353" __label="true"> Now I got my hand on the trigger, </span> <br> <span __num="354" __label="true"> but put your mind at ease, because my weapon </span> <br> <span __num="355" __label="true"> of choice is my brain, so I’m shooting consciousness </span> <br> <span __num="356" __label="true"> to anyone in need. </span> <br> <span __num="357" __label="true"> I know I can’t reach every soul that breathe, </span> <br> <span __num="358" __label="true"> because some like my style, and try to be me. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="359" __label="true"> One can imitate my walk, use the words I talk, </span> <br> <span __num="360" __label="true"> but they won’t feel what I feel, </span> <br> <span __num="361" __label="true"> because a lost soul feel what they think they </span> <br> <span __num="362" __label="true"> should, while what I’m feeling is real! </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="363" __label="true"> My hand is on the trigger within the depth of my soul, </span> <br> <span __num="364" __label="true"> because I’ve dismissed what was taught to me, </span> <br> <span __num="365" __label="true"> to shoot what I know. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="366" __label="true"> Yeah, with my hand on the trigger I feel bigger, </span> <br> <span __num="367" __label="true"> and my “S” stands for self, </span> <br> <span __num="368" __label="true"> and I’m shooting consciousness to the souls I </span> <br> <span __num="369" __label="true"> can help. </span> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="370" __label="true"> If you feel distress by the words I express </span> <br> <span __num="371" __label="true"> that’s another souljah down, because I’m </span> <br> <span __num="372" __label="true"> gonna keep my hand on the trigger as long </span> <br> <span __num="373" __label="true"> as I’m around! </span> </p>
