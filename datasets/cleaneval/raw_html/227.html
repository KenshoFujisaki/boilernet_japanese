And it explains why there is nothing sinister about this, for the figures simply demonstrate the consequences of women's biology and the choices that they make. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Here we look at the ridiculous, distorted propaganda propounded by the EOC, squeezed out from the very same figures. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="33" __label="true"> The EOC is currently trumpeting the fact that men, on average, earn quarter of a million pounds more than women during the course of their lifetimes, and that, therefore, this reveals some terrible injustice being done to women. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="34" __label="true"> So, let's look at what this figure really means. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="35" __label="true"> Firstly, it means that men pay about £90,000 more in taxes than do women. In other words, the average man puts £90,000 more into the pot than does an average women. Your average man is therefore supporting women to the tune of £90,000. Just one average man! </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="36" __label="true"> Bearing in mind also, that when it comes to benefits, such as health, pensions and income support, a whopping 70% of the budget is actually spent on women's needs, it is absolutely clear that the support, in the UK, given by men to women, is phenomenal, and it shows just how much the men in the UK truly hand over to women via the government coffers. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="37" __label="true"> Further, men also hand money over directly to women when they stay at home to look after the kids. And why shouldn't they stay at home to look after the kids if that's what the pair of them want? Why should feminists try to make women go out and earn the same as their partners? </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="38" __label="true"> So, what do the feminazis at the EOC do with these figures? Well, as usual, they twist their real meanings and turn them into man-hating propaganda. Thus, they are currently squawking loudly about this quarter of a million pounds with a deliberately distorted spin designed to make women feel aggrieved, disadvantaged and hateful towards men. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="39" __label="true"> But let me show you something. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="40" __label="true"> Imagine that the figures were the other way round. Imagine that women earned quarter of a million pounds more than men during the course of their lifetimes. What would the feminazis at the EOC be saying then? It doesn't take much imagination, does it? </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="41" __label="true"> Here are the headlines. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="42" __label="true"> "Women are having to do all the work. Women pay more taxes than men. The tax laws are discriminatory because they take more from women." And do you know what would happen next? There would be a major government initiative to stop benefits for men, and demand that they take up any work that was on offer. The government would set different tax rates for men and women in order to make sure that men could not benefit from 'sex-discriminatory' tax laws. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="43" __label="true"> But the EOC figures show that UK men put hell of a lot more into the pot, and they take hell of a lot less out of it. And it is still the case that while men die seven years earlier than women, they are still expected to work for five more years before receiving their pensions. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="44" __label="true"> This is going to change in the future, thanks to Brussels and the European Commission. But do notice that, working for five years longer and receiving seven years less of pension, adds up to a massive twelve years of financial injustice. A truly blatant, ongoing act of sex discrimination. An enormous act of discrimination. And what has the EOC done about this? Nothing. Nothing at all. </span> </b> </font> </p> <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> <span __num="45" __label="true"> People really must take on board the fact that the EOC is a feminist organisation dominated by all the selfish, self-centred slogans of feminism.
