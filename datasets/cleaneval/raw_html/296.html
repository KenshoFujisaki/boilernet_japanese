     <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Being an undergraduate student involves two main expenses: tuition fees and living expenses. </span> </p> 
     <p> <span __num="62" __label="true"> We classify all students as UK, EU or international for fees purposes. The amount you will pay for tuition fees and the financial support available to help you with this will depend on your fees classification, which will be determined in accordance with the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997. You will find further information about these Regulations at the following web address: </span> <a href="/academicregistry/fees/class.html"> <span __num="63" __label="true"> www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/fees/class.html </span> </a> <span __num="64" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
     <p> <span __num="65" __label="true"> If you are from the UK or the European Union (EU), your tuition fee for any course at Bristol will be £3,000 in 2006/07. The vast majority of other universities will be charging the same. The fee will go up by inflation in each subsequent year. You will not have to pay the money before or during your time at the University. You will only have to start repaying it after you have graduated and are earning more than £15,000 a year. The rate at which you repay the fee will be linked to your income. </span> </p> 
     <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> Information about tuition fees for international students and for students from the Channel Islands or Isle of Man appears at </span> <a href="/academicregistry/fees"> <span __num="67" __label="true"> www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/fees </span> </a> <span __num="68" __label="true"> . </span> </p> 
     <p> <span __num="69" __label="true"> Whether you are a UK, EU or international student, your living expenses will mainly include accommodation (unless you are a UK student living rent-free at home), food, entertainment and books. You can get a good idea of the cost of accommodation from the University's </span> <a href="/accom"> <span __num="70" __label="true"> Accommodation Office </span> </a> <span __num="71" __label="true"> . Your other living expenses will depend to a large extent on your way of life.

     <p> <span __num="72" __label="true"> If you are thinking of applying to study at Bristol, please don't be put off by the cost of studying and living here. There is help for UK/EU students who need it, both from the Government and the University. </span> </p>
