   <p> <span __num="21" __label="true"> Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered world) </span> <br> <span __num="22" __label="true"> and how (to what extent) he overcame them. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="23" __label="true"> Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a </span> <br> <span __num="24" __label="true"> Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study. </span> <br> <span __num="25" __label="true"> However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which destroyed </span> <br> <span __num="26" __label="true"> his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a </span> <br> <span __num="27" __label="true"> bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z </span> <br> <span __num="28" __label="true"> suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak, </span> <br> <span __num="29" __label="true"> read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes </span> <br> <span __num="30" __label="true"> how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand the </span> <br> <span __num="31" __label="true"> way to speak, read and write. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="32" __label="true"> Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision </span> <br> <span __num="33" __label="true"> worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single </span> <br> <span __num="34" __label="true"> object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side </span> <br> <span __num="35" __label="true"> of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon </span> <br> <span __num="36" __label="true"> he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or </span> <br> <span __num="37" __label="true"> mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see </span> <br> <span __num="38" __label="true"> would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside </span> <br> <span __num="39" __label="true"> down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted. </span> <br> <span __num="40" __label="true"> If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much </span> <br> <span __num="41" __label="true"> as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="42" __label="true"> Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were </span> <br> <span __num="43" __label="true"> imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged </span> <br> <span __num="44" __label="true"> area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual </span> <br> <span __num="45" __label="true"> memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist. </span> <br> <span __num="46" __label="true"> He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls </span> <br> <span __num="47" __label="true"> as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="48" __label="true"> Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his </span> <br> <span __num="49" __label="true"> reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other objects </span> <br> <span __num="50" __label="true"> around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he </span> <br> <span __num="51" __label="true"> can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware </span> <br> <span __num="52" __label="true"> of the positioning of his body's parts. </span> <br> <span __num="53" __label="true"> If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was. </span> <br> <span __num="54" __label="true"> He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces. </span> <br> <span __num="55" __label="true"> Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back </span> <br> <span __num="56" __label="true"> was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his </span> <br> <span __num="57" __label="true"> body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible </span> <br> <span __num="58" __label="true"> for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For </span> <br> <span __num="59" __label="true"> example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all </span> <br> <span __num="60" __label="true"> bewildered. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="61" __label="true"> Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going to </span> <br> <span __num="62" __label="true"> the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time </span> <br> <span __num="63" __label="true"> when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because </span> <br> <span __num="64" __label="true"> he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains </span> <br> <span __num="65" __label="true"> were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="66" __label="true"> Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no </span> <br> <span __num="67" __label="true"> sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He </span> <br> <span __num="68" __label="true"> perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts. </span> <br> <span __num="69" __label="true"> Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example </span> <br> <span __num="70" __label="true"> if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was </span> <br> <span __num="71" __label="true"> and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands; </span> <br> <span __num="72" __label="true"> he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed </span> <br> <span __num="73" __label="true"> to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="74" __label="true"> Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how </span> <br> <span __num="75" __label="true"> to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital </span> <br> <span __num="76" __label="true"> workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them. </span> <br> <span __num="77" __label="true"> They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More </span> <br> <span __num="78" __label="true"> misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example </span> <br> <span __num="79" __label="true"> when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his </span> <br> <span __num="80" __label="true"> foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to </span> <br> <span __num="81" __label="true"> reach out and touch things in his room. </span> <br> <span __num="82" __label="true"> He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest </span> <br> <span __num="83" __label="true"> things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria </span> <br> <span __num="84" __label="true"> describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a blindfolded </span> <br> <span __num="85" __label="true"> man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him </span> <br> <span __num="86" __label="true"> because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or </span> <br> <span __num="87" __label="true"> right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't </span> <br> <span __num="88" __label="true"> even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial </span> <br> <span __num="89" __label="true"> orientation. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="90" __label="true"> His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him </span> <br> <span __num="91" __label="true"> hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family </span> <br> <span __num="92" __label="true"> bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the </span> <br> <span __num="93" __label="true"> instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was </span> <br> <span __num="94" __label="true"> faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when </span> <br> <span __num="95" __label="true"> he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't </span> <br> <span __num="96" __label="true"> remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill. </span> <br> <span __num="97" __label="true"> By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not </span> <br> <span __num="98" __label="true"> immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very </span> <br> <span __num="99" __label="true"> difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to </span> <br> <span __num="100" __label="true"> associate words with them but he could only remember these for a couple </span> <br> <span __num="101" __label="true"> of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the </span> <br> <span __num="102" __label="true"> out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few </span> <br> <span __num="103" __label="true"> months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall </span> <br> <span __num="104" __label="true"> it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered </span> <br> <span __num="105" __label="true"> subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each </span> <br> <span __num="106" __label="true"> letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right </span> <br> <span __num="107" __label="true"> and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at </span> <br> <span __num="108" __label="true"> a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of </span> <br> <span __num="109" __label="true"> a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a </span> <br> <span __num="110" __label="true"> result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact </span> <br> <span __num="111" __label="true"> that he couldn't read out of his right eye. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="112" __label="true"> Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find </span> <br> <span __num="113" __label="true"> out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used </span> <br> <span __num="114" __label="true"> this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually </span> <br> <span __num="115" __label="true"> holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to </span> <br> <span __num="116" __label="true"> do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he </span> <br> <span __num="117" __label="true"> wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written. </span> <br> <span __num="118" __label="true"> The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read, that </span> <br> <span __num="119" __label="true"> being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive </span> <br> <span __num="120" __label="true"> practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he </span> <br> <span __num="121" __label="true"> wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any </span> <br> <span __num="122" __label="true"> kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The </span> <br> <span __num="123" __label="true"> injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with </span> <br> <span __num="124" __label="true"> language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a </span> <br> <span __num="125" __label="true"> patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words </span> <br> <span __num="126" __label="true"> and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what </span> <br> <span __num="127" __label="true"> `brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what </span> <br> <span __num="128" __label="true"> `brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short </span> <br> <span __num="129" __label="true"> sentences. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="130" __label="true"> Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years </span> <br> <span __num="131" __label="true"> writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or </span> <br> <span __num="132" __label="true"> one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He </span> <br> <span __num="133" __label="true"> didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently </span> <br> <span __num="134" __label="true"> wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his </span> <br> <span __num="135" __label="true"> ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every </span> <br> <span __num="136" __label="true"> word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing </span> <br> <span __num="137" __label="true"> about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what </span> <br> <span __num="138" __label="true"> he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he </span> <br> <span __num="139" __label="true"> no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on </span> <br> <span __num="140" __label="true"> writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer towards </span> <br> <span __num="141" __label="true"> the end of his journal. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="142" __label="true"> All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of </span> <br> <span __num="143" __label="true"> memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even </span> <br> <span __num="144" __label="true"> remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be </span> <br> <span __num="145" __label="true"> lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue. </span> <br> <span __num="146" __label="true"> If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely </span> <br> <span __num="147" __label="true"> difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be </span> <br> <span __num="148" __label="true"> thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example, </span> <br> <span __num="149" __label="true"> familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory </span> <br> <span __num="150" __label="true"> was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the </span> <br> <span __num="151" __label="true"> rest of his world. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="152" __label="true"> As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying </span> <br> <span __num="153" __label="true"> anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him </span> <br> <span __num="154" __label="true"> in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and </span> <br> <span __num="155" __label="true"> remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He </span> <br> <span __num="156" __label="true"> was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as </span> <br> <span __num="157" __label="true"> a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some </span> <br> <span __num="158" __label="true"> coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd forget </span> <br> <span __num="159" __label="true"> why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="160" __label="true"> Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things he </span> <br> <span __num="161" __label="true"> could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember </span> <br> <span __num="162" __label="true"> things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The </span> <br> <span __num="163" __label="true"> funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he </span> <br> <span __num="164" __label="true"> stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent </span> <br> <span __num="165" __label="true"> situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories </span> <br> <span __num="166" __label="true"> with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as </span> <br> <span __num="167" __label="true"> remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He </span> <br> <span __num="168" __label="true"> couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately </span> <br> <span __num="169" __label="true"> recognised them. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="170" __label="true"> Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been </span> <br> <span __num="171" __label="true"> pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd </span> <br> <span __num="172" __label="true"> learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well </span> <br> <span __num="173" __label="true"> as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone. </span> <br> <span __num="174" __label="true"> Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count </span> <br> <span __num="175" __label="true"> back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you </span> <br> <span __num="176" __label="true"> or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in </span> <br> <span __num="177" __label="true"> a way that a young child would. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="178" __label="true"> Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his </span> <br> <span __num="179" __label="true"> wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral </span> <br> <span __num="180" __label="true"> cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made </span> <br> <span __num="181" __label="true"> although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still annoy </span> <br> <span __num="182" __label="true"> him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space' </span> <br> <span __num="183" __label="true"> continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home </span> <br> <span __num="184" __label="true"> settlement. </span> <br> </p> 
   <p> <span __num="185" __label="true"> When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how </span> <br> <span __num="186" __label="true"> to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you </span> <br> <span __num="187" __label="true"> know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at the </span> <br> <span __num="188" __label="true"> most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort </span> <br> <span __num="189" __label="true"> to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved. </span> <br> <span __num="190" __label="true"> But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered </span> <br> <span __num="191" __label="true"> his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really </span> <br> <span __num="192" __label="true"> overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to </span> <br> <span __num="193" __label="true"> improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life </span> <br> <span __num="194" __label="true"> which had no real end. </span> <br> </p>
