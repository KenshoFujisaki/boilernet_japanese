         Land Tax is an annual tax based on land ownership and usage of land as at 30 June. Revenue from Land Tax is paid into the general revenue account of the South Australian Government, and assists in the provision of public services such as education, health and public safety.

Where a property was sold after 30 June, the vendor (seller) is still liable for the land tax. However, it should be noted, if the Land Tax is not paid at settlement it remains a first charge on the land and may be passed on to the purchaser.
