            The program fits into many areas of science curriculum FOR ALL GRADELEVELSINCLUDING EARLY ELEMENTARY.  Content tie-ins can be forces,motion,cycles, electricity, matter and energy, radiation/waves, generalphysicalscience, and some areas of geology, meteorology, and ecology. Withina specific Earth Science/Astronomy program, the Electronic Universe canservewell as an introduction to how we probe deep space as well as answeringstudents'questions later on and providing a capstone conclusional activity suchasone of our digital labs (see below for details).

            I like at least 60-90 minutes, but we can do a 30-45 minute session ormultiplesessions.  I don't mind doing several repeat sessions during aday. Minimally, I bring a laptop and LCD projector, so the room needs tohavea screen, be darkenable, and have a table for the projector andcomputer. If we are doing any of the technology pieces, then I bring in aportableCCD Camera and/or a small Telescope.  If we are doing basic SolarSystem/Sun-Earth-Moon,we may do some activities outdoors (scale models, and solar viewing).

            For the technology/measuring the sky program, there is extensivehardwaresetup, about 30 minutes, and also similar take-down time, and severalboxesof gear to transport, so placing me in one location and rotatingclassesin works best.  Since we do a lot of "hands-on" activities,classesshould be under 30 students.  We have found that "assemblies"don'twork for our main inquiry-based type of program.   If you'dlikea show-and-tell or pictureshow type of general program for an assembly,thatcan be arranged, but our program is primarily an inquiry-basedintroductionto the science of astrophysics, with a lot of participatory activities.

            Costwise, this year (2005)we are requesting between $10 and $100 perschool, regardless of numberof classes done, on a sliding scale, generally proportionate to thenumber of classes done but with consideration of available schoolbudget. (Example: 1 small class would be $10, a small �assembly� ormorning�s worth of individual classes might be $30, a multi-daypresentation to six classes would approach $100.)  This amountgoes to Friends of Pine Mountain Observatory, not to the instructor,and  is used to offset our overhead costs, primarily theproduction/distribution of the prep video, curriculum materials, andhardware usage.  NASA's Oregon Space Grant currently coversinstructor cost and travel costs for trips throughout westernOregon.  For extended distant trips, we may request someadditional funding to help cover the travel expenses.  Visitingmultiple destinations during one trip will help share costs.

            Oregon Research Institute (ORI), in Eugene, has created a VR programwherethe user can "fly" his/her craft around, above, and below the Sun,Earth,and Moon (other planets may be added later).  The goal is for theuserto conceptualize the motions, orientations, and views of these objectsbybeing able to gain a wide variety of physical perspectives not normallyavailable. Explorations include phases of the Moon and the orbits and periods oftheEarth and Moon and their relationships to the position of theSun. This program, called SEM, is funded by the Federal Department ofEducation. ORI Prime Investigator, Dr. Dean Inman, wrote the grant as a programdesignedto help Orthopedically Impaired (OI) students do science labs that theyordinarilywould not be able to access.

           <span __boilernet_label="1">
            When I saw the software in early Summer, 2002, I was immediately struckthatnon-OI students should also be able to put these explorations to gooduse,and also noted that the software serves to illustrate many of the ODE'sEarth-in-Spacebenchmarks.

            I am now working with ORI to develop teacher and student materials foruseof the SEM program, and will be introducing SEM in many of my outreachclasses. Dr. Inman and I will be looking for teachers who are interested incollaboratingto investigate the efficacy of SEM, comparing how students learn withconventionalstrategies versus SEM, for both OI and regular students.

            Starting from a rudimentary counting exercise, students can exploreimagesfrom various areas of the sky and images taken with a variety ofexposuretimes.  Questions can be generated concerning distribution ofobjects,types of objects, and how much of what's out there we are really abletosee, why and why not.  This is a very open-ended project that canbea real eye-opener to the vastness of space and the nature of howscienceis done and is very suitable for lower elementary grade levels.

           <span __boilernet_label="1">
            This involves astrometric (positional) measurements, over a period oftime. Starting by "blinking" (comparing) images of the same area of sky overoneor more nights, students can search for objects that shift relativepositionand then attempt to explain the shift observed.  Students canderivethe basic relationship between distance and parallactic shift and thussortout Solar System objects versus Galactic objects, discover asteroids,andcan begin to sort out the various planets at various distances andapproximatethe orbital radii.

            Another astrometric project involves the search for asteroids. Thisis an authentic research project with potentially very useful results(savingEarth!).  Students can request data or can scan archiveddata. Best done with Richard Berry's AIP4WIN image analysis software, whichwhencombined with a digital database, will allow the user to accuratelydeterminecoordinates of any candidates.  Data can then be compared withlistof known objects compiled by Lowell Observatory, and if object is trulyanew discovery, the discoverer may participate in the naming of theobject.

            This involves photometric (brightness) measurements and leads tomeasurementof distances, temperatures, sizes, and brings up issues of instrumentcalibration. At the basic level, students can intuitively conceptualize therelationshipsand can begin to characterize and classify objects in the sky.
