Depending upon those assignments, volunteers are dispatched to various sites where workers are most needed, during the 3 to 11 p.m. shift. St. Lawrence volunteers have been provided free lodging at a nearby YMCA facility. The project originated at a North Country Scholar Day admissions event in November; attendees included Disaster Relief Project Director for the Salvation Army Randy Widrick, a Colton, New York, resident who has been in New York City since September 13. On-campus coordination was done by St. Lawrence Leadership Academy Project Director

All are now part of the Town of Canton.
