   <span __boilernet_label="1">
    Many books and articles have been written arguing that someone other thanWilliam Shakespeare, the glover's son from Stratford-upon-Avon, wrote theplays and poems published under his name. There exist sincere andintelligent people who believe there is strong evidence that Edward deVere, Seventeenth Earl of Oxford, was the author of these plays and poems.Yet professional Shakespeare scholars -- those whose job it is to study,write, and teach about Shakespeare -- generally find Oxfordianclaims to be groundless, often not even worth discussing.
   </span>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Why is this? Oxfordians claim that these scholars are blinded to theevidence by a vested self-interest in preserving the authorship of "theStratford Man," and some more extreme Oxfordians claim that there is anactive conspiracy among orthodox scholars to suppress pro-Oxford evidenceand keep it from the attention of the general public. The truth, however,is far more prosaic. Oxfordians are not taken seriously by theShakespeare establishment because (with few exceptions) they do not followbasic standards of scholarship, and the "evidence" they present for theirfantastic scenarios is either distorted, taken out of context, or flat-outfalse.

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     This web site is for the intelligent nonspecialist who doesn't knowwhat to make of these challenges to Shakespeare's authorship. Oxfordianbooks can be deceptively convincing to a reader who is unaware of therelevant historical background and unused to the rhetorical tricks used byOxfordians. Our aim is to provide context where needed, exposemisinformation passed off by Oxfordians as fact, and in general show thenonspecialist reader why professional Shakespeare scholars have so littleregard for Oxfordian claims. We know from experience that we are notlikely to convince any Oxfordians to change their views, but we hope thatother readers will find something of value here. We will be updating andadding new material as time permits, and we welcome any comments orsuggestions.

     Antistratfordians try to seduce their readers into believing that thereis some sort of "mystery" about the authorship of Shakespeare'sworks. They often assert that nothing (or at most very little)connects William Shakespeare of Stratford to the works ofWilliam Shakespeare the author, or that the evidence which exists is "circumstantial"and subject to some doubt. These are astounding misrepresentationsthat bear little resemblance to reality. Indeed, abundant evidence testifies tothe fact that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the works publishedunder his name, and this evidence is as extensive and direct as the evidencefor virtually any of Shakespeare's contemporaries.

They are informal in tone, but I tried to make them as accurate andfactual as possible. The next two essays were written later, as parts oflonger essays in progress on Shakespeare's death and education. The last essay was written in response to Mark Alexander, one of the Oxfordianregulars on the newsgroup. Mark has always been a highly articulate and intelligentopponent, and he has often forced me to think through my own positions more thoroughly than I wouldotherwise have done. In this post, I address some of the broader issues involved in theShakespeare authorship debate, and try to articulate the major reasons why I find the Oxfordianapproach fundamentally flawed.

    The most obvious evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the worksattributed to him is that everyone at the time said he did: he was oftenpraised in writing as a poet and playwright, he was named as the author ofmany of the works while he was alive, and seven years after his death theFirst Folio explicitly attributed the rest of the works to him. Oxfordians try to account for this evidence by claiming that the man fromStratford was actually "William Shaksper" (or "Shakspere"), a man whosename was spelled and pronounced differently from that of the great poet"William Shakespeare," and that nobody at the time would have thought toconfuse the two. Needless to say, such claims bear little resemblance toreality. To see just how badly Oxfordians have misrepresented the nameissue, read David Kathman's essay on

To those who are familiar withElizabethan society in general, and with William Shakespeare's life inparticular, neither of these assumptions comes close to holding water.

He points out that nobody inShakespeare's day or for centuries afterward thought that the plays displayed anaccurate knowledge of royal courts (in fact, the opposite was the case), andthat modern social historians familiar with 16th-century court life have cometo a similar conclusion.

    Since William Shakespeare did not have much formal education, he must have beena voracious reader on many subjects. Oxfordians like to ridicule this veryreasonable inference; where, they ask, could Shakespeare have gotten the bookshe would have had to read? But in fact, Shakespeare was particularlywell-positioned in this regard. Richard Field, who grew up down the streetfrom Shakespeare and in very similar circumstances, became one of the leadingpublishers and booksellers in London. More importantly, he published many ofthe works his townsman Shakespeare relied on most heavily in composing hisplays.

     Belief in the Oxfordian story that Shakespeare's works were written not by Shakespearebut by the seventeenth Earl of Oxford requires not merely suspending the rules of evidence that would normally be used to establish the authorship of a body of work, but also accepting a set of Oxfordian myths -- tales that are presented as fact but that research shows are simply not true. Some of these myths have been repeated and handed down from Oxfordian to Oxfordian for decades, without any attempt being made to verify them.Here are three essays, each exposing an Oxfordian myth and demonstrating that the Oxfordian faith in them has been misplaced.
