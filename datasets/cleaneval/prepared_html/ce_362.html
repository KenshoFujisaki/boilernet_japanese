         The Child Workers in Asia Task Force on Child Domestic Workers is a regional Task Force with members from both the South and Southeast Asia sub-regions. It serves as a reference group for the network on strategies to address problems of child domestic workers in the region. Under the leadership of Visayan Forum Foundation as Convenor since its inception in 1996, it and its members have had an impressive record of advocating for greater visibility and treatment of the issue in the region. It is a regular collaborator with ILO-IPEC and Anti-Slavery International and has worked with these organizations extensively on experience sharing, research, and advocacy initiatives.

This workshop resulted in a plan to develop a Manual for Sustainable Advocacy for Child Domestic Workers. After a series of design and planning meetings, development of this manual is currently underway with the University of the Philippines Center for Integrative &amp; Development Studies Psychosocial Trauma and Human Rights Program (UP CIDS PST) and with support from ILO-IPEC. The draft manual was validated with member and other organisation working with child domestic workers in September 2005.
