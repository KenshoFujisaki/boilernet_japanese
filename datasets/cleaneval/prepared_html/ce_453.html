      Origen also took up the cause of freedom.

In contrast to the smothering violenceof the ancient State, and to the power and custom of public opinion, theChristians were the defenders of freedom, but not of individual subjectivefreedom, nor of freedom of conscience as understood today.

    The Christian teachers of the first three centuries insisted, as was naturalfor them, on complete religious liberty, urging the principle that religioncould not be forced on others: a principle always adhered to by the Churchin her dealings with the unbaptised. However, the imperial successors ofConstantine soon began to see in themselves as divinely appointed "bishopsof the exterior", i.e. masters of the temporal and material conditionsof the Church.

For the first time, also, the Old Testament was appealed to,though such appeals had been previously rejected by Christian teachers.St. Augustine, on the contrary, was still opposed to the use of force,and tried to lead back the erring by means of instruction:

The helpof the "secular arm" was therefore not entirely rejected; on the contrary,as often as the Christian welfare, general or domestic, required it, Christianrulers sought to stem the evil by appropriate measures.

    to do so. Theycannot justly claim that others who oppose them, even by imposing constraintson them, do an injustice either towards them or towards the general populationwhom they wish to address.

     The traditional teaching does however have one huge deficiency, theremedy of which does much to defuse the objections of a modern audience.Thisdefect is simple. Inadequate allowance is made for the intellectual spacethat is required for faith to grow. The traditional teaching views thehierarchy of the Church as ultimately wise and knowledgeable, and the Magisteriumcertain and

     <span __boilernet_label="1">

     </span>

     <span __boilernet_label="1">

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     and entirely passive in receiving the teaching, admonitions and judgementof the Magisterium. The business of the laity is to do and believe whatit is told. There is no need or place for question or debate  Thelaity have no competence to do either. If something cannot be understoodor seems to be wrong, it must nevertheless be accepted without hesitationas right: just on the basis of authority. Whatever comprehension is appropriateshould later be sought over time in prayer. Anyone with good will can beexpected to recognize the truth of the Magisterium's decrees more or lessimmediately.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Now in fact, all this is far from the case. For those who are not Catholics,the Magisterium has no particular credibility and commands little respect.This is first because there is no reason why the opposite should be thecase, and second because the Magisterium has manifestly been mistaken on

    There is no question here of taking an easy option. If dissent doesn'tseem a more troublesome task than conformance, then it is suspect. Thedissent that allows one to eat steak on Friday is a sham: no more thanself gratification. The dissent that allows one to use contraception becauseit makes one's own life easier is also immoral. For dissent to be anythingother than harmful, it has to be birthed in pain and fire, otherwise itwill lead to cynical scepticism and a loss of all faith. Dissent basedon a consciousness of an injustice done to some individual or group becauseof the imposition of some mistaken doctrine or practice is a differentmatter. This is a matter of charity for the victim(s) of injustice. Itis a prime duty for every person of good will to defend victims of injustice:even if the perpetrator of the injustice is

Moreover, the recent papal letter whichtried to stifle all debate on this matter upped the stakes.

    Quite by accident, I have recently read J.S. Mill's monograph on "Liberty".I found it to be an exciting and thought provoking book, and heartily recommendit. Mill points out that there are a number of reasons for allowing oreven encouraging dissent:

     <li>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Generally, dissident views are repressed and silenced by overbearing authority:hierarchical, social or economic, with no account as to their rightnessor justice.
