          The origins of computing machinery can be traced back to 3000years ago when the Chinese introduced a primitive form of abacus,or 300 years ago when Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz invented thefirst arithmetic machines. For us at CERN it all started 30 yearsago when one of the first electronic digital computers, a hugeFerranti Mercury, was installed. It was the beginning of a successstory which has changed the way to do physics and, as a matter offact, to do any work at all in the Laboratory.

          The story goes on and the changes brought in by the newinformation technologies continue to affect us at an astonishingrate. Those who witnessed the beginning of the information era wereconscious of the potential impact of those mar marvellous machineson Physics as well as on Society, but they could hardly imaginewhat was to come. In retrospect, we can say that the 30 years whichseparate us from the days of those first generation machines, havebeen years of struggle, of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and ofpainful reappraisal, but also years of discovery, of excitement, ofachievement and of pride to the actors in this uniqueadventure.

          The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury weretechnical, political and financial. Technically the Mercury wasdefinitely one of the most advanced machines around. It wasconsidered superior to the Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, tothe English Electric 'Deuce', to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and todrum-type machines like the IBM 650. Ferranti was set up to producea dozen units and CERN was going to get serial number 6. The factthat Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's was given a certainweight. CERN had no experience in electronic digital computers andit was better to be part of a club of users. As to the price (onemillion Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than equivalentAmerican machines like the ERA 1101.

          Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and 1956.External experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad Zuse'srelay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general purposecomputer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years afterMaurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues ofbinary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating pointarithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the EDSAC32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10 digitswords. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n forthe ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input andoutput data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or cards).Practical problems had to do with the unreliability of thehardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment ofexperts. Obsolescence was already a problem.

It was a significant advance inthat it allowed as many as six peripheral devices to access corememory buffers while the CPU performed other work. Anotherimportant device which came with the 709 was the so-called DirectData Connection, allowing for direct transmission of data fromexternal equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was notridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was alsoequipped with one of the first

          The bad news was still the poor reliability, although theprogress was already quite substantial. Unscheduled maintenancerepresented 11% of the total time. Scheduled maintenance took awaya time slice of similar size. So the down-time of the 709 comparednot too unfavorably with the up time of the very first electroniccomputers.... The on-line card reader and the printer did, however,slow down the operations considerably. After one year of experienceCERN added a small IBM 1401, in order to speed up the input/output,the job sequencing and the operations. The concept of SPOOLing(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line) with its 1/0 files(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in those days.

By theend of 1962 it was possible to read the paper tape from IEPs intothe Mercury, give it a first processing pass, write the resultson magnetic tape and input it onto the IBM 709 for furtheranalysis. The first application packages appeared at that time,e.g. THRESH and GRIND used for the geometrical reconstruction andkinematic analysis of bubble chamber events. It is amusing to notethat, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic developmentof codes, the machines were normally switched off at weekends. Butthe practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was around thecorner. It is also in interesting to realize that things like theconnection of the Ampex tape unit to the Mercury were entirelydesigned and implemented on site.

At about the same timecomputers were connected on-line to experiments to monitor theequipment and to collect digital data from the first filmlessdetectors (e.g. sonic spark chambers) onto magnetic tape. The firstsuccessful demonstrations with fully auto automatic digital patternrecognition showed that computers could be programmed to replaceslow human operators in a variety of tasks. Stories about computersdoing things faster, better and more reliably than human beings gotaround producing the usual mixture re of emotional reactions. In1970 the European Physics Society held a Conference at CERN on the'Impact of Computers on Physics' and I remember the reassuringstatement of an eminent physicist that 'so far computers have notsignificantly contributed to any discovery'.

          Actually the two disciplines have influenced each other from thevery beginning. It was the physicist Bruno Rossi who built thefirst logic circuits which then were developed into computerhardware, and physicists have always been among the mostdemanding consumers of computer cycles. Enrico Fermi, when asked inthe early fifties which research project would he recommend to theyoung Italian physicists, told them to design and build a computer.Indeed, physics research could not have become what it is withoutthe computer, and conversely, the development of the computer hasbeen deeply influenced by the needs and vision of basicresearch.

Computer scientists have beenplaying with models and formalisms, architectures and languages,inventing tools and methodologies of a rather theoretical natureand they have been sometimes accused of developing generalsolutions in search of specific problems.

ThenChippewa OS (COS) was installed. It evolved to SCOPE which waseventually used after adapting it to CERN needs. This resulted in anon-trivial amount of changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERNSCOPE. The 6600 was connected to various FSD systems and to twoon-line computers, the SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made datalinks. In terms of processing capacity the 6600 was about threequarters of a CERN unit or ten times the 7090.

          The change-over from the IBM 7090 was planned to take threemonths starting in January 1965. Major engineering overhauls had tobe done instead during the first few years and ended up in atwo-months shut-down in 1968 in order to modify the 6600 toincorporate logic and packaging improvements which had beenintroduced in the production machines. During this long period ofstruggling with hardware instabilities and software development andchanges, computing work was done partly by sending jobs to outsidecomputers and partly by processing data on a CDC 3400, and later ona 3800, temporarily made available at CERN by Control Data.

          The 3800 was a member of the 3000 series CDC family ofcomputers, incompatible with the 6000 series machines. Moreconventional than the 6600, the 3800 had a 48-bit architecture. Thecore memory (64 Kwords) was replaced by a faster one (800 nsec)during its staying at CERN. This machine was eventually acquired bythe State of Geneva and installed at the local University. At CERNit was replaced by a CDC 6400. It is worth noting that CERNacquired other machines of the 3000 s series, e.g. a 3100 for theFOCUS project offering semi-interactive facilities and quicksampling of experimental data at the central computers, and a 3200for interactive graphics applications.
