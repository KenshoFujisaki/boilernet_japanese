     calls"the first systematic accounting of how this nation confrontsemployers who kill workers by deliberately violating workplace safetylaws." A few of the other findings disclosed in a December 22 articleby David Barstow:
    </span>
    <br/>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Although causing the death of a worker by willfully violatingU.S. occupational safety laws is a federal crime, from 1982 to 2002 thefederalOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) declined to seekprosecutions in 93% of the cases in which the agency itself concludedthat the workers had died because of "willful" safetyviolations by employers.
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Moreover, repeat offenders got off easy. "Having avoidedprosecution once, at least 70 employers willfully violated safety lawsagain, resulting in scores of additional deaths. Even these repeatviolators were rarely prosecuted," Barstow writes.
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       In the OSHA bureaucracy "victims' families are frozen out, butcompanies adeptly work the rules in their favor." Since 1990 OSHA hasincreasingly bowed "to employer demands that it replace the word'willful' with 'unclassified' in citations involving workplacedeaths...even for employers who have repeatedly shown a deliberatedisregard for safety laws, resulting in multiple deaths."
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       In two decades OSHA's enforcement of the law has led to jailsentences totaling fewer than 30 years. In a single year, 2001, theEnvironmental Protection Agency obtained prison sentences totaling 256years.
      </span>
      <br/>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Barstow's article, part of a series, "When Workers Die," on how theU.S. government deals with the worst cases of death on the job, issubtitled"A Culture of Reluctance."  That's an understatement. It is aculture of cruel indifference and criminal malfeasance.

     Is that optimism justified?  It depends on many factors,including (but not only) the position of the U.S. government, which isone of 53 government members of the UN HumanRights Commission.  The Bush administration is hardly an advocateof expanding international obligations in the area of human rights,labor, and the environment, and relies heavily on the views oforganizations like the U.S. Council for International Business.

       The norms draft does indeed contain a very broad set of(non-binding) obligations, mostlyreflecting and clarifying standards that already exist in manyinternational treaties and conventions. But it is only a draft, andsubject to revision. Instead of battling to bury the norms and allthey represent, you would be wise to use the Council's influence tomake thenorms workable and to render them conducive to promoting corporatesocial responsibility.

       Governments actively protect the rights and interests ofbusiness not only through domestic legislation but more and morethrough a network of international law and intergovernmentalorganizations. But there is a huge void in international safeguardsthatprotect the rights and interests of labor. As global integrationintensifies, and global communications increase, that void becomes moreand more difficult to ignore,and more and more difficult to justify.

Indescribing the family Christmas eve that we wouldcelebrate at our son's house in nearby Ashburn, Virginia, I located it"close to where Lee crossed the Potomac, only to get beatenat Gettysburg."  After most of the letters were in the mail, I gotan uneasy feeling about that sentence. I decided to check a map.Of course, Lee's army was actually defeated at
