    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     a) Headform specification: - David Spenciner - We currently reference a draft international standard (ISO 6220) that has been discontinued in our helmet tests. Intention is to take the information from this document and put it in ASTM format than we would have our own headform standard. The document was balloted and there were 3 comments and 1 negative.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Negative: Dave Thom - Frankfort plane vs. Basic plane. No evidence that the Basic plane corresponds to Frankfort plane. EN960 is referenced in this document but Frankfort plane is not mentioned in EN960. If there is a reference that ties these two planes together, then it should be listed in the headform draft. If not, then the term "Frankfort plane" should be taken out. It was determined that this wording can be removed as an editorial change.

     2) Comment from Jason Brand &amp; Dave Thom - 4 typos in document. 2 pages of text and 5 pages of tables. The numbers (typos) in the tables will be changed to reflect what is currently in the ISO draft standard. Dave Spenciner commented that in moving forward, there should be some review of these numbers at a later date. These would not be editorial changes.

   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     3) Comment from Jacques Tholin deals with the possibility of the headform rotating on impact. Energy used in rotation is not captured by linear accelerometer. This was discussed yesterday at shirtsleeves meeting. Will wait for Jacques Tholin to come to next meeting for further explanation and discussion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     4) Comment from Guillaume Bélanger - (Section 4) Suggests that all headform sizes should be included from A-Q as per EN960 instead of only the 5 sizes (A, E, J, M &amp; O). After extended discussion it was concluded that this topic along with the shape geometry will be discussed as part of the next revision, since this document has passed main committee.

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     6) Comment from Celia Peterson - Cross reference to ANSI headform C which is a part of ASTM F355 (playground equipment) (similar to DOT standard). - There is another reference that they can use, original ANSI standard or DOT standard.

     Congratulations were given to Dave Spenciner for completing this standard. Dave will get with ASTM editorial staff regarding small changes. The document then moves on to publication. Dave will then start work on possible revisions to the published document based on comments provided at this last ballot.

     c) Labeling - Jason Brand - Jason had put together a spreadsheet of all labeling from each of the standards of this subcommittee plus two from Ice Hockey subcommittee. Some revisions were made after the Pittsburgh meeting and copies were sent to the labeling task group. More assistance is needed. The plan is to specifically look at F1446, revise, look for commonalties and then suggest labeling for " use only for ..." and multiple standards. After F1446, will go through remaining standards and revise as needed. Keep in mind label requirements for CPSC and CSA.

     d) Dynamic Strap Test (F1446) - Roy Burek - Ballot item - Purpose of suggested change dealt with instructing technicians on how to adjust the harness when testing to remove variability. 1 negative and 2 comments. Negative - Dave Spenciner - The proposed change was not clear. Needs clarification to add an extra step. Wording changes - should be appropriate "referenced" headform. An additional wording change regarding "impact headform". Will confirm with ASTM to make sure these changes are editorial. The changes will be made and the negative was withdrawn.Comments - Additional comments were discussed from Dennis Piper, Jason Brand and Jeff Skein.

     6) Martial Arts Helmet - Dr. Dennis Lieu - The task group met yesterday with approx. 12 people at the meeting. The draft specification was covered in detail. Copies are available from Dr. Lieu. Progress has been good, and there has been good cooperation. The draft martial arts specification came from already existing ASTM test methods and some of the work from Dr. Lieu's laboratory. The draft currently calls for 2 types of tests.

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      a) Falling test, standard ASTM test, low &amp; high energy levels

   <span __boilernet_label="1">
    This is not a one time use head gear. Needs to survive multiple impacts over an extended period of time. A Hybrid III head was proposed. The impact tester for the swing arm needs to be built. Low temperature test was eliminated. Test line - area of testing was expanded where impacts are expected. Eliminate max. mass specification. Headgear must protect the wearer and opponent (striker). Labeling will have to be reviewed. Discussed life span recommendation. It was noted that there is a European martial arts standard.

     10) Soccer Headgear - Dennis Piper - The letter from the US Soccer Federation (lead team physician) regarding the draft soccer helmet standard was read to the subcommittee. Dennis Piper chaired the task group meeting. About 25 people attended. The helmet would protect against incidental impacts in soccer, primarily from goalposts, the ground and other players, not specifically heading. The draft went out for ballot and received many negatives. These were discussed in the task group meeting. One negative was regarding the retention system in the draft required a hard shell. There was a vote that there should not be a hard shell-dependent retention system in the standard.

     Additional equestrian activity - Dave Halstead has sent a letter to Senator Dodd who is head of a committee that is looking at a bill in the US Senate that would require the CPSC to adopt an equestrian helmet standard. This is similar to the legislation that required the CPSC to adopt a bicycle helmet standard. The legislation would list the adoption of the ASTM standard, and not one from the CPSC. The issue of updating the standard is also included in the letter. There has been no response since the letter was sent 9/6/02.
