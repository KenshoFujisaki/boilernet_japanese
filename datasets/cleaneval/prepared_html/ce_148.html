Wehear a mentally unstable former bra model who once had a one-night encounterwith McManus—and whom the exec had arrested after she threatened to tellthe press—recently went on a rampage after hearing about hispromotion.

       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        The sordid affair began when McManus, at the time V.P. for CBS Sports, wentto an Upper East Side bar on the night of the 1997 U.S. Open and met

        It was at this point that their memories of the evening diverge. Von Vogt hasclaimed that she and McManus embarked on a night of drinking, drug use, andkinky sex. In court, an attorney for McManus categorized the whole encountersimply as “a chat, a walk, a drink, [and] a simple and chastegoodbye.” The one thing that’s certain is that after the two parted,von Vogt began to call McManus nonstop, demanding that he acknowledge what sheclaims transpired between them and pleading with him to attend a session withher psychiatrist. When she finally threatened him in February1998­­—after 15 fruitless calls, many of which McManus secretlyrecorded—that she would go public with her story if he persisted indenying what ocurred, he had her arrested for harassment and“telephone stalking.” (McManus, incidentally, had just gottenmarried the previous June.)

        When the case went to court in 1999, McManus was cross-examined twice aboutthe evening in front of a press-filled gallery. (So much for keeping it out ofthe papers.) Von Vogt, however, suffered a nervous breakdown during theproceedings—brought on, she claimed, by the investigatorsCBS had sicced on her—and the judge declared her unfit for trial.Afterwards, her attorney,

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        According to a source close to the trial, von Vogt only saw the therapistbriefly before dropping out of sight—until October of this year, whenMcManus was announced as the incoming CBS News head. We’re told she began calling the female shrink nonstop, venting her anger over the exec’s promotion and claiming “she was going to use [the psychiatrist] to get toMcManus.” Then, last Halloween, von Vogt followed the shrink fromher office and attempted to push her into oncoming traffic on York Avenue and75th Street in Manhattan, screaming, “You Bitch! You piece of garbage! You’rejust a pawn to get to McManus!” She was arrested and, last we heard, was beingheld without bail.

        staffer—whose identity, while known in media circles, has been kept out of print—has been keeping a low profile since the Halloween attack, when Braunstein, a onetime co-worker at the fashion glossy, reportedly gained access to her Chelsea apartment by masquerading as a fireman, knocked her out with chloroform, and tied her to a chair before sexually molesting her for 12 hours.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        “I’ve been dealing with some issues because we’re very concerned about her privacy while this guy is still at large,” said Goldman. “It’s obviously very disturbing that he’s still out there and that he’s evaded the authorities for all this time, so any kind of identifying information that could lead him or other people to locate her is a major invasion of privacy that could put her life in jeopardy.”
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Among the published details she finds particularly worrisome are where the victim works, where she lives, and even the name of her next-door neighbor, the attorney said. “And that’s not an inclusive list,” she added.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        While some have speculated that the victim hired a lawyer to keep her own identity under wraps until she is prepared to go public in some remunerative fashion, Goldman insists that’s not the case. “I wasn’t retained because she’s working on a book or movie or any nonsense like that,” she said. “I was retained because she was concerned, as anyone would be in her circumstance, about her privacy and her safety.” She added, however, that her client might be interested in telling her side of the story “somewhere down the road when this guy is incarcerated.”
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Goldman—who explained she was chosen to represent her client because the two women “share a mutual friend”—said although she herself relies on newspaper reports for developments in the case, she is frustrated by how much info the media-savvy Braunstein might be gleaning from the coverage.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        “Some of the reporting I’ve seen just seems to me incredibly irresponsible,” she said. “If I’m reading a report in the press of somebody saying, ‘We just saw him at x location going to all these strip clubs,’ don’t you think that he reads the papers and says, ‘Oh, guess I better not go to any more strip clubs?’” Asked whether she had considered the possibility that police had planted those stories to flush Braunstein out, Goldman admitted, “I don’t know what law enforcement does during these situations, but as a citizen reading this stuff, it just strikes me as foolish.”

        (a former campaign spokesman, now director of the state Office of Planning and Research) were not acting with his knowledge or at his behest when they disseminated the slur. Our source says that, in papers filed in his defense, the governor has even denied any official connection to “Californians for Schwarzenegger,” the nonprofit reelection committee that is paying the trio’s legal fees. If that’s the case, the governor may want to refresh his memory. According to municipal documents, Schwarzenegger owns Main Street Plaza, the Santa Monica building that houses the committee’s headquarters.

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        In another curious passage in his defense papers, we’re told that Schwarzenegger “denies that he has a history of sexual misconduct… and the Claimant must prove the grounds on which she alleges that any such history is now admitted or well-documented or was at the time of his election campaign a matter of public knowledge.” While the governor may somehow be under the impression that Brits can’t read American publications, which have obsessively covered Arnold’s multiple groping allegations, the governor’s own admission that “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” and that he’s “behaved badly” towards women have been trumpeted by a dozen UK papers as well.

        . After the former stuntwoman announced the day before Schwarzenegger’s election that he had grabbed her breasts, Walsh told reporters that Miller had a history of prostitution and drug abuse. Though the allegations were completely untrue, Miller’s suit was overturned in court thanks to America’s defendant-friendly libel laws. (Luckily for Richardson, Brit law puts the burden of proof on the defense in such cases.)

       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        At the end of the day, Schwarzenegger’s maneuvers will probably come to naught. Ever since a judge declared the governor was “not peripheral” to the case, experts have predicted that a settlement is the only way for Schwarzenegger to avoid an inconvenient appearance before a judge in a powdered wig—probably during his 2006 reelection campaign.

There was no evasion of service.” The high-priced attorney did confirm that there had been “numerous communications between me and the plaintiff’s lawyer,” but he wouldn’t go into detail. As for a settlement, “we haven’t discussed it,” he said, adding, for good measure, “You’re a tabloid reporter, and these are stupid questions.”

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Despite the lockdown, Jackson and Schaffel were cleared to make the video at the site. “Representatives of the Parks Service said that the go ahead for us to use the Lincoln Memorial had come straight from the White House,” Becker recalls, adding that Jackson returned Kuo’s favor by providing backstage passes to a concert at RFK Stadium in D.C., and that the presidential adviser then “invited members of my staff to the concert and had them over to the White House mess hall for lunches.”
       </span>
      </p>

       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        In the end, the project was scuttled after Schaffel’s XXX-rated resume became public. Becker says he lost $120,000 of his own money that he had invested in the filming, expecting to be reimbursed.

      </p>

       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        “When it came out that Schaffel was in gay porn and that Jackson had some serious legal problems, Kuo tried to act like he never knew them,” Becker said. “It would have been laughable if I hadn’t been taken for all that money.”
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Reached for comment, Kuo acknowledged that he had met with both Schaffel and Jackson about the tribute—”I met with hundreds of people a week at the White House”—but denied that he had helped gain them access to the Lincoln Memorial. “After 9/11 the White House was tasked with reaching out to people from the charitable world and Jackson had gotten in touch with us about some song that he was doing just like he had done ‘We are the World,’” Kuo said. “I didn’t have a relationship with either guy, and I never invited staff on the project to come eat lunch at the cafeteria.”
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Kuo claims that concert promoter Clear Channel, not Jackson, provided his backstage passes to the RFK concert. And his opinion of Jackson? “I met him for a few minutes,” Kuo said, “and I had no particular reaction.” Kuo insisted that as far as he knew, no pedophilia charges had been brought against Jackson at the time.
