              For a number of reasons you are better off looking like alocal citizen rather than a standard American tourist. Don't misinterpret this. I love the USA and all that it represents, but I try to avoid being an American billboard when I travel overseas. The primary reason is to avoid being a target of pickpockets, a breed endemic in Europe. You might also think that it could avoid being caught up in terrorist bombings as London had in July 2005. That is probably not an issue since the murdering sons of bitches just kill anybody, including fellow Muslims praying at their local mosque.

              For many years my personal preference was a pairof black slip-on shoes, wool/polyester blend slacks, turtleneckshirt, and sport coat. This ensemble will get you through almostany door in Europe with reasonable respect, keep you comfortableunder most weather conditions, and allow you to blend in withoutbeing instantly identified as "the American."

              The wool/polyester blend slacks look more like wool thanplastic, but they wash drip dry. You won't need to iron theseif you care for them according to the label. Levi Strauss has introduced a new Dockers line available in several colors besides the normal khaki. A couple of pairs of the dark charcoal served me well throughout Europe on my January 2006 trip. Turtleneck shirts arenot common in America. In fact I couldn't find a single one in December 2005. The men's shops all said that they weren't in style this year. Booosh! You can find them inski clothing shops. If you are not in ski country get catalogs from Lands End and from L.L Bean for a good selection. I ended up buying a couple of good cotton T-necks at the V+D department store after I arrived in Holland. An open collar dress shirt is a good substitute for the turtleneck in warmer weather. In very few restaurants is a tie required, though you'll see them often in better establishments. For off-season travel, I also bring a lightweight turtleneck sweater. My sport coat has a herringbone pattern and travels very wellwithout showing wrinkles or minor stains.

              Levi's and other brands of denim jeans became fashionable inEurope in the 1990's. Levi's are now tolerated in many cafésand restaurants during the day. However, regular slacks are muchmore common as street wear in major cities throughout Europe. Based on my observations of people walking through the central train stations of Europe less than 20% were wearing denim jeans. The preference for the vast majority, men and women, young and old, was black slacks.

              Slacks are also much more in harmony with packing light. Levi's areheavy and bulky, and take a day to dry out when they get rained on. If you do wear denim, select a lightweight pair with a bit of fashion. You might want to consider wearing Levi slacks rather than Levi jeans. Levi Strauss makes a good looking line called "Action Slacks." These are 100% Dacron and travel very well. Wash them off in the shower at night and hang them to drip dry by morning. I have a couple pairs in black. I recently switched to another Levi Strauss product for my European travels and everyday wear. These are charcoal Dockers, 55% cotton and 45% MicroPolyester, style number 405189256. They are very comfortable and look like dress slacks.

              Dressing well does not have to apply only to Europe. I had drifted into wearing Levis at my local pub in Michigan a few years ago. One night last summer I was returning home from an event where I was wearing a jacket and slacks and decided to stop in at Oscar's, my regular place, to shoot some eight ball. It wasn't long before a young lady about half my age started bumping into me and making strong eye contact. After that I started wearing slacks and a dress shirt when I went to Oscar's. Approachments by young dames has happened again and again to the point that it has become embarrassing, but I won't brag on it. Guys, listen up here! Dress sharp and you won't need all those bull drop lines to meet a girl in Europe, or anywhere.

              I would expect that a woman dressed in Levi's would normally be approached by a man in more or less the same low-life outfit. It's only speculation, but I guess that if you want to meet the prince of your dreams in Europe you would dress to the nines. Why not? Besides, women in Levi's are about the most asexual creatures on the earth. I don't know why girls wear Levis. They are so unflattering to the derrière. And it won't cost you much to dress better. It will probably cost you less than that name brand stuff. Think, have you been to your local second hand store recently. They have some great stuff at laughingly ridiculous low prices. You will want to tell your friends, as I have just done. Male speaking, I just bought a London Fog brand, zipper in liner,trench coat for $40. It looks better than the the one in my closet that I bought 15 years ago for $140. Well, I must admit that it is a bit out of fashion. Most coats in Europe are black and the length is just above the knee, so this thing is the wrong color and a foot too long per current styles.

              Dress in "layers." This means dressing in items that can be added to orremoved individually without changing everything when the weatherchanges. For example, instead of a heavy overcoat wear a sweater and a windbreaker. If it gets too warm in the afternoon take off the sweater and carry it in a shopping bag. Dressing in layers requires that all of your clothes be complementaryand mixable. Dark, neutral, and earth colors tend to avoid fashionclashes, and do not need cleaning as often as lighter colors.

              Instead of shoes, I have become a convert to sandals, morespecifically Birkenstocks, a German brand. Once you break in a pairof Birkenstocks you will never go back to shoes again, except forduring stormy weather. You won't even want to go barefoot again. Birkenstocks have a half inch of cork between the hard rubber bottom and the leather part you rest your feet in. Cork is very easy to walk on. You can go all day in these things. I recommend black socks with the Birkenstocks, unless you are at the beach. Birkenstocks are expensive so you can make this one of your purchases when in Germany, at prices 50% less than the American prices.

I was withsome business associates in The Hague a few years ago and wedecided to take a pub crawl. Two of them had just bought new joggershoes and wore these out for the evening stroll. Several placeswould not allow them in the door. These places were just youraverage Dutch cafés and bars, not fancy or up-scale. Andmy associates were businessmen in their 50s, certainly good potentialcustomers in any establishment. Those doormen want to keep their jobs so they keep theoff-spec people outside. Nothing looks clunkier than freshwhite tennies. I've heard that the French call them marshmellows. In my Amsterdam and Brussels train station observations, jogger shoes were worn by less than 5% of those passing through, usually by young people with backpacks.

              An alternative for those who like tennies is the Florsheim line of shoes called "Comfortech." These are light weight black slip-ons with a cushion bottom. They look great at a distance and will get you past any maitre d' or doorman.

              Weather protection is essential. Bring a telescopingumbrella. You can find umbrellas which slide down to under 10 inches. A lightweight hooded mackintosh is veryhandy for those frequent all day rains. A light pair of leathergloves and a hat are helpful for off-season travel, and can even beuseful in northern Europe in the summer.

              Friends who have read this book often say that it is overly male oriented. A major reason,perhaps, is my discussion of clothing, but the attitude probablysurfaces in other areas as well. I've seen packing lists on the internet written by women who must have had a platoon on hand to carry their utterly essential stuff. Some girls claim that they simply can'ttravel with only a carry-on bag, and some bring everythingbut the kitchen sink on a weekend sortie.

              I used to travel like that but learned the hard way how todo it the easy way. For a weekend trip to Paris with my Dutch girlfriend many years ago I packed two suitcases with six days worth ofextra clothes and other just-in-case stuff and drove over to pick her up.I was amazed. She wore a black jumpsuit, colorful scarf, a fashionable raincoat, and carried a slightlyoversized purse with everything she needed. Although our room was a nice one in an above averagehotel, there was hardly enough space to hang my things or stash thesuitcases. My precious Paris time was wasted putting things away,deciding what to wear, and repacking everything.

You don't necessarily want to askyour hotel. The manager may direct you to one of his associates orsub-contractors. That is not always your best deal.

              One challenge to the scrub-it-yourselfer will be in hanging your clothes if they are still dripping. This applies to slacks, skirts, shirts, blouses, and other outer-wear. If you have no bathtub or shower in the room, use anewspaper to catch the drips. Sometimes a bit of ingenuity will beneeded to figure out what to tie your line on. Some rooms arealmost impossible. Strapping tape can sometimes come to the rescue. See

              Take care in using the clothing size conversion tablespresented in travel books. Tables differ. Sales clerks are seldomknowledgeable or helpful on this. They know less about Americansizes than you can learn about European sizes. Size tables areposted in some of the large department stores, though in somestores I have seen conflicting conversion tables for American toEuropean sizes on the wall and on garment packages. I have boughtthe same size under shorts with the same brand name in two differentEuropean countries. One was loose and one was tight.

              The morning shave is probably the one thing most men wishthey could do without, but it might be better to continue shaving.Beards invoke suspicion in many people (e.g., customs agents andairport security folks), fear in some (e.g., young women), and instantdislike in most of the rest (e.g., hotel clerks and maitres d').You don't need hassles and rejections from these folks while youare traveling. But then again, wearing a beard saves time and trouble in the morning so make your own call on this. Try to keep it neatly trimmed if you have a beard. I have had a beard for many years, on and off.I put up with the hassles for the convenience of avoiding the morning scrape. See

              Traditionally, European women do not shave their legs. But theyseldom show much leg (except at the beach) since their dresses and skirts overlap their boots. An American woman traveling in Europe couldeasily escape the regular leg shaving. In addition, many European women do not shave under their arms. These traditions are crumbling and women generally shave these days. Whether or not to go traditional is a matter of personal taste.
