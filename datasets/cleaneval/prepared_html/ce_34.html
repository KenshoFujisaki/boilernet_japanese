                              Dear Richardson Family, I am so sorry to hear that your Michelle passed away. It sadden's me. I never met her, but heard all wonderful and good things by her grandmother. She was a beautiful woman. I know she is in heaven dancing with god and his angels and will be young and beautiful forever. May god be with you now and always. Michelle is in my prayers. God Bless you all.

                              I loved her from the day she was born, my beautiful grand-daughter, Michelle, now an angel in God's kingdom where love reigns supreme, where pain is no more. Cancer devastated her body, but never her spirit and her love of life she fought for so valiantly, and so long. The memory of her will live on to help ease the pain that we, who loved her deeply, feel at her passing. My sweet Michelle, I miss you so!

                              Michelle was an inspiration to me. She never gave up hope in her battle, she always had her sense of humor and made the best of the situation.. I came in contact with Michelle last year when I was going through a colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. I was very scared, being only 23 and having gone through this at a young age, she was able to relate to the anxiety and fear I was experiencing. She gave me hope and courage no matter what the outcome would be. Thankfully, I was clear, but later that year I lost my grandmother and my grandfather both to cancer. They were both only in their 60's and they raised me, so this was like losing my parents. Her words gave me strength, and her story inspired me to make the most of every day and to live my life to the fullest. I will truly miss Michelle and my thoughts and prayers go out to her grieving family as I understand what they are going through. May they find some peace in knowing Michelle is no longer suffering.

                              I just found out about Michelle. I'd had suspicions that she wasn't doing well since I had invited her to some shows and she hadn't replied. I figured she was doing poorly and just didn't want to be seen or to have to talk about it. Michelle was first diagnosed while she was directing my play in the Minnesota Fringe Festival. Even while she was in treatment she went ahead and directed the show. Throughout her entire illness, with every setback she was still fighting, taking lessons, auditioning, etc. I was continually amazed at her will to live and keep going. I feel bad that I just now found out and wasn't able to go to her memorial. My deepest condolences to her family and all of her other friends. Goodbye, Michelle.

                              Dear Michelle's Family I did not get to meet Michelle but met her through the Ratlist, When I visited her web page I shed Tears of Joy and sadness I spoke off list to your wonderful daughter she, truly was and inspiration to many who are taken from us before their time. We shared laughter about the antics of our rats, and I cry knowing I will never talk across the virtual ether to her again, I have lit a candle for your family, and pray that I will also meet Michelle at the Rainbow Bridge, Them most amazing thing about Michelle was not only her courage but her Wonderful Sense of Humour. I felt I knew her and I loved her like a daughter. And I truley believed she was called from this world as there the need for a New Angel in Heaven, and Every time you have that pain in your hearts it is just Michele Plucking your Heart Strings and Skating around your Souls saying "I have not left you, My Spirit is here with you, and I will be with you always Till we meet again at the Bridge". And she will welcome all with her Cheeky Humour and Beautiful smile and with Love with Wrap you all in Her Angels Wings. May your memories of her Bring you Joy and keep you smiling. I was Blessed to know her for such a short but forever special time. Love and Peace to you all.

                              My deepest sympathies go to Michelle's family. She and I became friends at Stephens, and even closer at Oxford. After graduation, we lost touch, though we did share the odd email. While at Oxford, we were in a production of 'Steel Magnolias' - I was M'Lynn to her Truvy...I'll always remember her that way - incredibly happy and enjoying being a Brit.

                              I want to give my condolences to the Richardson family. I first found your daughter's sight when I was diagnosed with cancer exactly a year ago this month at age 27. It was nice to have someone my age to talk to and help me understand what treatments I had coming. I prayed for her to enter remission as I did. Just know that she helped many of us through our darkest hours and if your family ever needs anything I will be there for you. Love Stacy

                              I hadn't heard from Michelle in awhile &amp; I hadn't been on here because my cancer came back &amp; I have been very sick. I decided to come on here today to check my e-mail &amp; look at things I hadn't seen in a long time. I decided to check out Michelle's site to see how she was. I am utterly devastasted that she is no longer with us. It is so unfair that such a beautiful person had such a short life. I found her site when I was first diagnosed &amp; everything she went through at first was identical to what I was going through. She helped me so much when I thought I couldn't get through this. She would e-mail when I was down &amp; give me encouragement. She gave me such hope &amp; now I am just totally devastated. I feel so bad that I just found out now. I just want her family to know that I prayed for her daily &amp; that you should be so proud &amp; were so lucky to have had such a wonderful &amp; beautiful angel in your life. I know that she is looking down on all of us that she helped &amp; loved &amp; she will continue to help us. My heart is hurting so much right now. Even though I only talked to her on-line, I considered her a dear friend. My hope was to meet her in person one day. I will miss her more than words can say. I don't know how I'm going to get through this without her. Thank you to her family for sharing her with us. God Bless You All! Love, Maria

April was a Chemo Angel for Michelle, but for April..it was more like Michelle was the Chemo Angel for April. I know that Michelle became a very important part of April's life and she will be missed greatly, not only by her family and friends but by anyone and everyone that knew her. I really believe there is a special place in heaven for people like MIchelle. May God Bless all of her family and friends in this very hard time of sorrow. Try to see Michelle in every sunrise and sunset. In every song the birds sings, and every flower that blooms. Michelle will only really be gone..if we fail to remember her. Again..God Be With All of You ! April's Mom. Diana

                              Dear Bobby, My aunt, Ilona has sent me the website of her memories. I�ve seen her picture the first time. I was touched deeply. Since I�ve never met you and her I can only feel the spiritual connection with you. God give you the strength to remember. Your cousin T�nde (and all my family)

                              The world will miss her. Michelle was my assistant director for my original stage play of "What's the Matter with Sara Jane?" and directed my first native American play, "The Return of the Windigo?" She was ill during both of them, but you would never have known it! She was lovely, intelligent, brave, talented, and beautiful. I feel honored to have known her. My deepest sympathies are with you for having lost this wonderful young woman, and we can only hope she is directing plays and shining wherever she is now.
