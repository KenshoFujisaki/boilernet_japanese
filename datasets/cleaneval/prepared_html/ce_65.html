          Jon Lasser began the Bastille Linux Project in order to harden thesecurity of Red Hat Linux, the distribution he uses at work. In theprocess, he began looking at the other distributions to see how theyhandle security updates, and he was not at all happy with what hefound. In today's editorial, he shares his concerns and explains whyit matters to you even if you do all your security monitoring foryourself.

          As a professional Unix systems administrator, I'm concerned aboutsystem security. Keeping unauthorized users off my systems is simplypart of my job; doing this requires vigilance in the form ofmonitoring performance, reading logs, and keeping patches up-to-date.For me, security is about security; it's about keeping my users'projects safe and keeping them comfortable despite a full-timeconnection to the Internet.

          , a hardening script for Red Hat Linux, Ithought my job was to make Linux more secure so beginning users couldeasily keep their boxes secure. Often, new Linux users have noexperience as system administrators or often even any experience withUnix. I thought the best way to tackle the problem was to make it easyto do the right thing.

          Recently, I've been asked lots of questions about Linux systemsecurity by reporters. Often, I'm put on the defensive right away: DoesLinux have a security problem? Why is Linux less secure than otheroperating systems? Is open-source software inherently less secure thancommercial systems?

          they're exploited, and that thenumber of actually-exploited holes is no greater -- perhaps even less --than commercial software.

          These are all mainstream Linux distributions, tending towards ageneral audience; at the least, they're not aiming at the router marketor the embedded devices market. These are all products intended to beused by normal people and thrown up on a corporate network or eventhe Internet. Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but I'ma fairly advanced user myself, and I still expect that my softwaredistributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That'sone of the reasons I don't roll my own distribution.

          Of the eight common distributions I could think of, three havenothing whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of theothers didn't seem to be doing anything useful.

          Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reportersthat many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little theaverage user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount oftime to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security,as I am. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work.These people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work todo.

          If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systemswouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems havebeen exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a yearold, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a professional,I know that they shouldn't even be running it, because I know thatthey're not using it. But I can't expect them to know, and I can't evenfix it myself: I didn't know that some of these machines existeduntil I found out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users to read asingle, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty goodsolution -- when those lists exist.

It's about preserving our reputation for quality, andit's about saving time and money.

          Sadly, most people don't realize the risk they're putting themselves at bydoing this without installing and configuring security tools. Even asimple thing like NukeNabber for Windows can help avert a systemcompromise, if the user is aware enough to yank the phone line out of thewall when a port scan is detected by it. I have little sympathy forpeople who's machines get compromised due to their own ignorance andincompetence.

For them it's a tool, not a hobby.It's much more cost effective to have an expert configure their computerthan it is for them to do it themselves.

          That's just the way it is. If you want Linux for the masses, it must beidiot proof. If no distro makes the idiot proof LAN workstation, then eachnetwork sys admin will have to cook up their own.

Idon't see Linux as a hobbyist's toy, I see it as a tool that I'd like to beable to use at work (much as Mr. Lasser was talking about). In a LANsetting, not everyone is a sysadmin, and in fact, that could never work.People can be perfectly productive UNIX users without understandinganything about inetd.conf. I know I was for years.

          The simple truth remains that there just is no such thing. The securityof any system, no matter what OS it is running, is a function of thecluefulness of the admin. A well run Linux box will be more secure than apoorly run OpenBSD install. A well run NT server will be more secure thata shoddily maintained Solaris 7 box.

          Clearly, one must learn Unix if one expects to administer a Linuxmachine. And that includes home users. But still, most LinuxDistributions that I have run across, Slackware and Debian included, makeassuptions about system installations that are not, from a securitystandpoint, logical. For example, installing a telnetd server by defaultis probably not a good idea. Having it installed and configured to acceptremote connections by default is horrific! Yet this was the case when Iinstalled Debian 2.1. Debian 2.2 (Potato) is a little smarter than this,but thats not the official release (yet).

          2- You gotta cover your own ass. Ultimately, your computer's safetyis your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your ownresponsibility. Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the networksecure. They also have security guards and alarm systems and such to keepthe physical premeses physically secured. At home, you have locks on yourdoors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep intruders out of yourhome. I say "help" because the fact remains that if someone really wantsto break into your house, they will, alarm system notwithstanding. Thesame is true for computers on the 'net. If someone *really* wants to getin, they will. There are, however measures that can be taken to make itmuch more difficult.

"But Windows just works" is the party line... primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install. They buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which comewith Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install Windows ondozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how insecure theyare when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go surfing the net.

I don't think it was intended to tell us what distribution to use, or whoto boycott; rather, it was intended to tell us what we should do aboutsecurity, why we need it, etc. The common quote from most web sitedefacers is "Security is a Myth". This is true for the most part, but ifwe all look at security and pay attention to it rather than sloughing itoff, it doesn't have to be a myth.

          You write, in trying to apologize for your unfair treatment of Slackware:``In the old days [...] Slackware had huge numbers of security holes.''This sentence enforces my suspicion that your article is based much moreon dated stereotypes than real understading of what goes on in the Linuxsecurity area.

          If you go back to some time around 95, I grant you that Linuxdistributions used to resemble leaky buckets more than a secure OS. This,and the fact that Linux was ignored both by CERT and (to a large degree)by bugtraq as well lead to the establishment of various Linux securityresources--such as a the linux-security list.

          Working in the security area myself I can on the other hand understandyour apparent frustration. Making an operating system more secure is anuphill battle you cannot win. Distributors make mistakes in integratingsoftware with their product (or they make choices you consider a mistake).Programmers insist on putting the same bugs into their programs over andover again (do a grep strcpy over the pine sources one day). Many usersexpect things to "just work" and don't take security serious until theyget hacked.

          On the overall scale, Linux security has improved a lot over the past fewyears--and while I agree that there's a long way to go, progress willdepend at least as much on creating more secure software in the firstplace as on the vendors' timely delivery of patches.

          Security (my definition) is a measure of time -- a double ended timeline, separated in the middle by an event... a breach or loss (X). Onethe left side of that event is the time leading up to it, the time beforeit happens -- not if, rather when. To the right of the event, is the timeit will take to recover from the event -- to fully negate the loss.

          I can certainly says from experience as a system administrator thatthe most secure systems are the result of a skilled administrator takingthe time to get all the necessary information (and keep up to date so youare a moving target) and apply all the necessary upgrades andconfigurations. However, a system administrator is not going to besetting up most machines anymore as Linux begins to bump out that other OSfrom the desktop. Indeed, many server situations fall into that arena. IfI were to set up and configure a Linux desktop for someone, there are a LOTof things I'd be doing to the system AFTER installing the distribution,with security changes being in the lead position, and other things likemanageability being next (for example, cleanup scripts that ensure logsdon't fill up /var).

I've used both Slackware and Redhat and I have todo a lot to both (more to Redhat but still a significant amount toSlackware) to make them secure. I don't clean inetd.conf ... I shut offinetd itself ... on many systems. Every distribution should leave everyservice that could listen on a port or pipe turned off, even lpd. Duringinstall, and at any time later, there can be the option to enable specificservices. But unless those actions are taken, the services should beinstalled in such a way they are not running until properly turned on.

          Jon Lasser brings up some very good points, and his editorial iswell-suited to the Linux community. As one of several student Unixsysadmins in the computer science department, I have to deal with the sametypes of things he does. One of the reasons we've opted not to go withLinux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is because (1) wefeel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable and secure thanLinux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven environment in which ourCS students can code. This does not prevent many attempts to exploit ourmachines, however. On the average, I spend nearly twenty minutes *perhour* scrounging through logs and checking stats to ensure that my fellowstudents are safe at what they do best (coding).This does not come at an easy price. Since I'm only one of a fewsecurity-minded student sysadmins, I have to make sure that my coworkersare kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories and fixes,etc.[I mean this as no offense to anyone, but I've also noticed that the ircnetwork EFNet seems to split a lot more often now that Linux ircds havepopped up. Things weren't this way when they stuck to *BSD daemons. *sigh*]I simply wish we could all just listen to what Jon Lasser was trying topoint out instead of nitpicking over the details of whether or not aparticular distribution has security lists/pages/whatnot.

          Yes of course I am bias towards Slackware. It is in my opinion the bestdistribution. I have used Debian, RedHat and Stampede along some of theBSD flavors. I am not going to say Slackware is the most secure Linux, butthat is only because I agree with the comment about the administratorsbeing the security. As far as getting a distribution secure in a shortamound of time, Slackware is darn good.

          Unfortunately most people who've responded have missed the whole point. All major distributions which I'm aware of come out of the box with toomany services enabled, and too many potential holes for new users to copewith. They could all use a front-end script or dialogue which would asknew users what actually needs to be enabled, and then disable everythingelse by default. I would rather assume that users who need the serviceswill need to learn enough about the process to be able to enable themthemselves anyway.

          The author makes a good point that if newbie users start havingsecurity problems all over the place because services they know nothingabout and could care less about are enabled by default, this could have adetrimental impact on the Linux community in general with bad press if,for example, many thousands of these unsuspecting users become mail relaysand stop-over points.

          The users who need these services will do the necessary research (itis hoped) to be able to use them in the most secure way possible, and tokeep on top of security advisories etc. But you can't expect everyone whojust wants to use Linux for themselves to be on top of it all.

          Jon stats that when he used slackware it was way back when the securitywasnt considerd. And that his article was written not in attempt to attackslackware and other distro's but to show the need for security in linux. Hemight not of ment for the attack on slackware but when a nobody, nerverused linux user read's your article and decides to go with linux from thefacts that u offer he will determain to follow redhat when your facts arntuptodate or even fully looked into. Thats why it attacks slackware becausethe pertential users belive what they read. And this lowers the possableusers for slackware to increase. Also i couldnt write a arctile onWindows systems if i had only run win 3.1 and win 98/2000 was latestventure. I would only be showing my lack of facts on that subject.

          In my opinion, workstation distributions *should* be more or lesssecure by default - with the exception of unforseen things like bufferoverruns in packages etc. Why do you need to telnet into a workstation?disable it by default. Why do you need ftp? pop3/imap? www? disable it. Ifthe user needs it, they can set it up themselves. They need to learn.

          I think that there has been an adequate listing of the incorrect facts inthis article. The author should probably go back, re-think the premise,get his facts straight, and re-write and re-submit this editorial. Idon't think that something so obviously full of omissions and (yes, evenwe Linux people do it) FUD should be left posted in such a high-profilelocation. And Mr. Covey, (or someone from the FM staff) please do alittle fact-checking of your own on these? Thank you.

          5 minutes a month is bullshit, if users dont want to spend any brain powerperhaps they shouldn't be using computers at all?And as far as bettering the security on the net, im sure most distribs aresecure when they're released, it's just after time that people go lookingfor problems, which is a good thing, but that is also why you should belooking at least once a day, if you want to keep your box secure.And my final comment for the day, when something has a mailing list, suchas slackware, it shows the maintainers are looking out for the problemsand putting them at one central location for the users to look at, see aproblem, then go and get the patch or do whatever needs to be done.

          If it takes more than 5 minutes a month, it's not going to get done. Really, non-hackers just can't be bothered with this kind of stuff. That's why, if you want to improve the overall security of the net and thereputation of Linux as a whole, you need to secure it at the source: thedistributions need to be more secure by default, and it needs to bepossible for installations to remain secure without the end users havingto spend any brainpower on it at all. Because they just won't.

          You have misinformed people. There is a Slackware securitymailing list. Slackware is secure and so is Debian. We're nottalking about 'the old days' here; we're talking `today`.I hope you get a lot of flames on the subject, as you flameda lot of good distributions out there. Even in your sorrymessage you don't stop flaming and make wrong assumptionsabout certain distributions, since these cannot be calledfacts. I don't know/care if you're getting paid to do thisbut it certainly looks that way. Well, you obviously got aname now, Jon Lasser.

          Perhaps half an hour a day was a bit too much for the average person.10minutes would work just as well, quick skim of the headlines on yourlinux site orreading the security mailing list. These are not hard nor time consumingthings to do. And as far as picking out one trivial thing, if he got thiswrong when it's blatently obvious and easy to find on the site (thesecurity list), i was wondering whatelse he had missed or not cared to inform anyone of, in his pursuit ofthis editorial.

          I noticed about 3 people claiming that Slackware is quote "the most securedistrobution" around. This is in fact not true, and neather is saying"Redhat is the most secure" or Debian or Caldera, or any distrobution orOperating system. Even your linux box in the corner of your office with astatic ip, with just telnet and ftp services running, and all the latestpatches you can think of put on it; is ALOT less secure then if you pullout the ethernet wire. In this day and age there is no "most secured"linux distrobution. There is always something else you can do to make itjust a little more secure.

         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the peoplewho released the distrobution. Which means in fact, that hundreds ofdifferent programs, written by hundreds of different people are on thesame computer. Thos will also mean that there is a very likely chancethat one or more of those programs will have security problems. And I amnot just talking about Linux, or just Unix in general. Look at Windows 9598 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of programmers work on them, fromone major company, and there was a mistake in codeing that caused remoteusers to be able to disconnect them from the internet. Something likethat could happen in the linux world also, a popularly used program thathas a tragic flaw.

         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Personally though, as many other people have said, when firstinstalling any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up inetd.confdisableing services that arent needed. Slackware is the same way, alongwith other problems. So you can't say that out of the box Slackware is themost secure, because it just plain isn't. Neather is anything.

          Ok... maybe you can, but you should at least install and test thelatest version (especially with slack 7.0, since its changed quite a bitsince even 4.0, not to mention slack95) of the OS before stating "I haveto consider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I cananswer. These distributions' total lack of concern with security is anembarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities."

          Exploits come out for Red Hat first because there are more targets onthe net. Exploits used to come out for SunOS 4.x for precisely the samereason, but that didn't mean that Ultrix was more secure. (Point of fact,it probably wasn't, it was just less tested.) And the fact that Red Hatreleases security fixes fairly promptly means that it's possible to securethe system in a pretty much up-to-date fashion.

          But that only answers half the question: so now I know why people takeSlackware to be the target (because I made a mistake which gave them afoothold from which to attack me), but why do they think it's all aboutRed Hat? On the basis of the article, it seems clear that SuSE, Debian,and Mandrake are all probably more secure than Red Hat. The fact that I'vegot a whole project just to secure Red Hat seems as much proof as any thatit's not especially secure -- but the fact that they've got some securityresources certainly means they're trying.

          I think people took it as an attack on slack because what was said iswildly untrue, slack may have been a pile of security holes in the past, idont know, as i said ive only been using it since 3.2, but i dont think youshould hold patrick to past mistakes, as slackware now is (IMHO) verystable and secure. Check out any exploit site and see how many exploitsthere are against slackware vs. redhat or any other dists, people mayargue that this doesnt prove much, but it puts me at ease.

          What I can't understand is how so many people who have beeninvolved with Unix and Linux for so long still use the termhack to refer to a computer break in. Machine's can gethacked, but that's usually a good thing. People gettinghacked? Not too sure about it, but whoever it is might notlike it. Hacking software, now that's something that's areal good thing. There are many other kinds of hacks, someof the more famous ones are listed at http://fishwrap.mit.edu/none of these have to do with computer break in.I agree though, that several distros are not secure to start with, and ittakes a lot of reading to secure a new system.

          I can't speak to the security or insecurity per se of Slackware 7, asI've not used it, but I'll note that most of the recent security holes inRed Hat and Debian (with the very notable exception of problems with RedHat's usermode tool -- a very, very serious problem) have been bugs in theunderlying code, not particularly related to either of those distributions.If those bugs aren't present in Slackware, that's either because thosepackages weren't included in Slackware (not a bad thing, just a point offact) or because Slackware fixed those bugs before anyone else knew aboutthem and failed to backpropogate the fixes. I don't think it's thelatter.

And the sources neverseemed to be able to produce the binaries which were included -- sometimesit was obvious that the included sources were pre-slackware-patches, as thecompiler would spew errors. I certainly hope (and to some degree expect)that this situation's been cleaned up by now, but this made it impossibleto audit slackware's security if you wanted to.

          But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack onSlackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that. Icertainly think that Slackware's record on security could standimprovement -- I'm more impressed with a large number of found and fixedbugs than an apparent lack of them in a full-featured Linux distribution-- but as far as I'm concerned in the article, this isn't about anyparticular distribution.

          It's also about the importance of Linux's image in the media, andsimple things we can do to improve that image. If you personally don'tcare who besides yourself uses Linux, that's fine. But I need Linux tolook good in the media, so that I can push for it in appropriate projectsat work and elsewhere. Also, a good image for Linux in the media makes itmore attractive for companies (ie Creative Labs) to write open-sourcedrivers for hardware which is nice to play with. :-)

          Is it just me or does this "professional" not know what hes talking about? Ive been using linux since slack 3.2 and ive found that slack is the mostsecure distro, with debian coming in second and redhat coming in somewherenear dead last, being the hackers paradise of buffer overflows and 'enabledby default' services that it is. As far as the security/patches/supportgo, check out slackware.com and see whats at the very top of the page,also slackware.com/lists. While jeff did make some good points and touchon some issues that need to be addressed, he should really take a closerlook at the actual OS next time.

          is dis other distributions versus discuss the problem. Are we so insecurethat we have to build a religion around what distro we use and why theothers are evil? Its like watching a Baptist convention talking about theevils of Catholics/Lutherans (and as about as worthwhile).

          Slackware 7.0 is a very big improvement over earlier versions out there.Patrick seems to be much more in tune with putting out things with the4.0/5.0/6.0 Betas than I have seen him do in years (since the 2.x days). Idont know the reasoning behind it, but once slackware.com came intoexistance... the quality of the Slackware machines I dealt with seemed toincrease also. I dealt with too many people with hacked Slack95 boxes withexploits that had been around way too long. Going to the cdrom.com siteusually had out of date info. Now I see a central site and people findthings rapidly and cleanly.

          I used to use slackware up until 1996 when I switched to Red Hat because Iwas tired of finding exploits and the Slackware response was "Well patch itand compile it for yourself. We will put out a fix next release"... whichnever came. When I found them in Red Hat, I saw an RPM at a central spot.

          Defining security without using the word "secure" is a task into itself. We've all installed a linux distribution, and we've all gone and cleanedout inetd.conf. All of us. Everyone one of us. Think about it. Howmuch time and energy is wasted to clean out inetd.conf? To turn offportmapper? To do all the rest?

          This article doesn't compare Linux security t o Microsoft security, itcompares it to being absolutely secured. I'd love to have a pre-securedLinux box, and the way this new market works, if there are other peoplelike me out there, we'll find a distribution that does it, and switch toit. Others will see our choice and begin to follow suit. Being "secured"and remaining useful at the same time is a thin line to balance on.

          I think one of the main concepts that is missed here is that the average,non-expert, trying Linux because they're tired of Microsoft user doesn'twant a system that they have to do any real configuration on. They wanteverything to work, even if they have no need at all for the servicethey're running. You'll get users demanding that the ftp daemon work,only for you to find out that they're logging in to the machine from thesame machine, and have no real need for it to be running at all. Tellthem that it's a good idea to disable it, and they'll say that they'might' need it, and want it there. Current distros do seem to haveserver written all over them, but that doesn't really seem to be themarket they're trying to hit lately. Some companies don't have theresources to re-release their software every week. There are deadlins forpressing the CDs, writing the manuals, testing the software, etc.., etc. It's not always very practical to try to include the latest fix everyother day in the released distro. As for security advisories, for Calderago to http://www.calderasystems.com/support/security/ I love it whenpeople say things don't exist...

          I have to agree with jwz on monitoring for security patches. That should bethe job of the system administrator(s). End users have more importantthings to do (as far as the company is concerned) than monitoring patchesfor their OS. If the system administrator doesn't know where to look forsecurity advisories and patches, then maybe it's time to find a new systemadministrator. I am not a system administrator. I'm one of those geeks atthe company that brings in money on contracts. I have enough things to doat work that I don't need the added burden of duplicating the work of mycompany's system administrators (no matter how bad they may be).

          Having many distros may be a plus, in some ways, but it's also adefinite minus too, considering that the (potential) user needs toconsider the pros and cons of each (or just run out and buy the newestversion of Red Hat like most people these days :p). And significant energyis wasted duplicating efforts to keep patches up to date.

          Okey, First,its not the flavor of Linux that you are ruinning, its theperson behind the computer. Computers don't get hacked, people do. IfAdmins are stupid and don't know how to secure an OS, then certain peoplewill take advantage of them and their computers. Second, Redhat is bad.Everytime a new version of Redhat comes out is because there are tworemote exploits for the previous version. Well, it just depends on theadmin, not the flavor of Linux system.

          I can not believe someone that has been in the job area for anytime wouldmake those assumptions about Slackware. It is by far the most secureflavor out there. And there are lists and sites for Slackwarewww.slackware.com and www.linuxmafia.org just to name two. When I do acomparison of changelogs I see RH has about 10+ security fixes and growingfast Slackware only has 2. In the 5.2 vs 4.0 we saw about 30vs3 . Redhat isgood mind you but should be saved for the workstation or webserver with nousers type install. As long as they try and change programs from theoriginal authors intent they will have this problem they taint about 40%of the apps included if you look at the odd ball versions they give them. Slackware on the other hand uses programs as is and does virtually nomodifications which always seems to get RH in trouble. They have thismindset that once they "brand" a program the user thinks its going to bebetter I this is almost never the case and alot of this is done by what Icall "KTWFF" Kids That Work For Free. As for the others Mandrake isnothing more than a modified RH and falls into the same catagory Debian ispretty good about security but also gets prone to the above but is stillmuch better. Sorry to flame on so much but the public is so miss-informedthat it just scares me sometimes and the RH jaugernaut scares me also. Ihave been in this biz for some years now and when I get hired for consultand I find they are running RH that is the first thing to go I dont knothave the time to try and keep up with it. Flame off

          I am a bit suprised that such a "serious" guy can wrote this on slackware.By experience, it's the most secured linux I know. People before me addcomment on the mailing list, and the repository of patch. You can noticethere are few patches, it's because Patrick Volkerding has always takecare of security in his distribution of linux before releasing it. thereare also less packages than other ones but I sleep better.

          An another point to answer to jwz, if you can't spend half an a hourper day for security issues, security is definitely not a concern for you,sorry. I'm a bit curious, what is your model of security OS ? Windows ? Soyou never had a look on securityfocus (and others).

          The power of linux is in distributions, everyone can find his "good"distribution, so let the people of distributions works, help them, askthem for new features, but don't ban them. You are missing the real enemyand misunderstanding the open software.

          I'm a home and work user of Linux, my flavour of choice is Slackware. I'veused most of the major distributions and am forcedto use a few at work. As far as Slackware goes, it does have a securitymailing list which i am subscribed to, it can easily be found atwww.slackware.comwhich also tells you that all of the current and future versions dir treeswill have a patch dir, with patches for that particular version.I also sit on a 24/7 internet connection, with a static ip, i get at least1 hack attempt a day. And strangely enough none of them seem to haveworked. Why? Because i spend half an hour a day checking new email forproblems,and checking websites for problems with anything i'm running. So if thisprofessional sys admin has misinformed you of the slackware side oflinux,what else could he be wrong about? I could be interpreting him wrong, or imight just not be thinking clearly tonight, but i dont and never have hadproblemswith the slackware distributions.
