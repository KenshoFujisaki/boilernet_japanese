     Our members have a strong interest in the legitimate and lawful use of all information, including Social Security numbers.  Used properly, SSNs play a substantial role in reducing fraud, enhancing workplace security, promoting public safety, supporting homeland defense, reducing state and federal entitlement fraud, enhancing child support enforcement, and facilitating commerce to a diverse, mobile electronic society.

     Before I specifically address how the SSN is used by our industry and the importance of this number, I have found it helpful to provide a short review of what a consumer reporting agency is, what is contained in a consumer report, and the law that governs our industry.

      CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND CONSUMER REPORTS
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Consumer reporting agencies maintain information on individual consumer payment patterns associated with various types of credit obligations on approximately 190 million Americans.  The data compiled by these agencies is used by creditors and others permitted under the strict prescriptions of the FCRA.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Consumer credit histories are derived from, among other sources, the voluntary provision of information about consumer payments on various types of credit accounts or other debts from thousands of data furnishers such as credit grantors, student loan guarantee and child support enforcement agencies. A consumer's file may also include public record items such as a bankruptcy filing, judgment or lien.  Note that these types of data sources often contain SSNs, as well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     For purposes of data accuracy and proper identification, generally our members maintain information such as a consumer's full name, current and previous addresses, Social Security Number (when voluntarily provided by consumers) and places of employment. This data is loaded into the system on a regular basis to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     It is interesting to note that the vast majority of data in our members' systems simply confirms what most of you would expect; that consumers pay their bills on time and are responsible, good credit risks. This contrasts with the majority of systems maintained in other countries, such as Japan or Italy, which store only negative data and do not give consumers recognition for the responsible management of their finances.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     As important as knowing what we have in our files is also knowing what types of information our members

      THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (FCRA)
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In addition to our general discussion of the industry, we believe it is important for your Subcommittee to have a baseline understanding of the law which regulates our industry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was significantly amended in the 104th Congress with the passage of the Credit Reporting Reform Act.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Congress, our Association's members, creditors and consumer groups spent over six years working through the modernization of what was the first privacy law enacted in this country (1970). This amendatory process resulted in a complete, current and forwarding-looking statute. The FCRA serves as an example of successfully balancing the rights of the individual with the economic benefits of maintaining a competitive consumer reporting system so necessary to a market-oriented economy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     The FCRA is an effective privacy statute, which protects the consumer by narrowly limiting the appropriate uses of a consumer report (often we call this a credit report) under Section 604 (15 U.S.C. 1681b), entitled “Permissible Purposes of Reports.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Some of the more common uses of a consumer's file are in the issuance of credit, subsequent account review and collection processes. Reports are also, for example, permitted to be used by child support enforcement agencies when establishing levels of support.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Beyond protecting the privacy of the information contained in consumer reports, the FCRA also provides consumers with certain rights such as the right of access; the right to dispute any inaccurate information and have it corrected or removed; and the right to prosecute any person who accesses their information for an impermissible purpose.  The law also includes a shared liability for data accuracy between consumer reporting agencies and furnishers of information to the system.

      SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER USES
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Let me now turn to the question of how our industry uses the SSN.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, our industry has a duty to “…employ reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy…” of the consumer report.  Further, we must design systems that accurately allow our customers to extract
    </span>
    <u>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      only
     </span>
    </u>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     the data requested on a specific individual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     We must accomplish this dual mission of accuracy both in terms of building databases, but also properly identifying files in our systems in the context of a highly mobile society.  Consider the following:
    </span>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Approximately 16% of the nation's population moves each year according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which means many addresses change each year.  (This equates to approximately 42 million Americans)
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Based on National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated that there are 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces annually.  This event frequently triggers changes in addresses as well as last names.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In 1998 there were 6 million homes in the U.S. that are considered vacation or second homes.  Consumers often switch billing addresses if they stay at such residences for long periods of time and in some cases maintain billing addresses for both residences with various creditors.  (Source: U.S. Census Bureau House Vacancy Survey as extrapolated by the National Association of Realtors)
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     These data clearly speak to the challenge our members face where identifying data often changes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In light of the mobility of our society, the Social Security Number plays a very significant role in ensuring data quality.  Our members process 2 billion data elements a month.  These elements are a combination of credit history data and identifying information.  Consider the following very real example.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Where a consumer has changed a last name due to marriage or divorce and has moved to a new address, which is common in either case, the SSN is the most stable identifying element in the file.  First, it helps us to identify the consumer's file with precision during this life transition where he or she is likely applying for new credit, seeking approval for utilities, and seeking to rent or purchase a new residence.   The consumer expects that the consumer report will be available for all of these necessary transactions and the SSN helps our members to meet this expectation.  Second, the consumer expect his or her file to be accurate and the SSN helps us to maintain the file accurately even when the consumer is in the midst of updating creditors with changes in name and address.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     The SSN is also a critical element in producing information products, which are commonly called locator services.  These services are made available, for example, to child support enforcement agencies for purposes of locating non-custodial parents;
    </span>
    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">
     <span __boilernet_label="1">

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     to pension funds which must locate beneficiaries; to law enforcement for locating criminals or witnesses;

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      [6]
     </span>

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     to healthcare providers that must locate individuals who have chosen not to pay their bills, to state benefits agencies to reduce public assistance fraud,

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     and for other similar uses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Further, the SSN plays a role in fraud prevention products.  Where a consumer makes application for a product or service, information products that help the business to ensure that they are doing business with the right consumer use information products to authenticate or verify the application information.  This is true in both for bricks-and-mortar business and in e-Commerce.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     If applicant data does not match, then the business can take additional steps to verify the consumer's identity and thus prevent fraud.

      CONCLUSION
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In conclusion, you can see by our actions that in large part our uses of the SSN are governed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, one of the most extensive privacy laws in the country.  Beyond law, our members have a history of proactively limiting how SSNs are used outside of the FCRA.  No one particular element of information is the key to identity theft.  The underlying theme in all of this is balance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Laws that overreach in attempting to limit use of the SSN are likely to merely take fraud prevention tools out of the hands of legitimate businesses at the expense of consumers.  Ironically, to prevent fraud you must be able to crosscheck information.  To maintain accurate databases, you must be able to maintain a range of identifying elements.  Absent the availability of the SSN, we will be less able to build accurate data bases, to accurately identify records and to help prevent the very crime through the development of fraud prevention and authentication tools.
