          Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter is setting up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul Hatch: "We found that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect of the meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen book. Discourse then ran the full gambit of topics."

          Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first meeting will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two volunteers will take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the merits and pitfalls of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone else can add their spice to the debate on either side.

          After the success of the first Fight Club we knew there had to be a follow up debate, so here it is:

         <em>

           Sex and Violence

         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Most of Europe and Canada have less than 100 mortalities per year through violence, whereas the US averages around 11,000 through guns alone. The US has also cornered the market in its pornography business and yet has one of the tightest restrictions on nudity on TV. Is it not also contradictory to blur out partial nudity while we can watch decapitations in full gory detail on primetime TV?
         </span>

         <br/>
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          This no-holds barred �street debate� will cover these topics and also discuss the effects sex &amp; violence has on TV viewers, what censorship does, etc.
