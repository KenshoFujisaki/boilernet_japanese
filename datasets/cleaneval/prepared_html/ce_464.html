                                    Dr. Peter Singer, a tenured professor of the Center for Human Values at Princeton University, is one of the world's most famous and influential philosophers. He's best known for his most infamous idea: that parents who aren't able to care for their newborn baby—healthy or not—should have the right to kill it.

His numerous books and articles have appeared in countless translations all over the world, and his writing style appeals to a wide range of audiences, from the most intellectual to the most popular.

He doesn't doubt or deny, but in fact strongly affirms, that from the moment of conception human embryos are human beings, as are all of the other humans he's willing to kill. From a genetic/biological point of view—especially with our advanced technology—it would be absurd to deny that any of these are members of the species "Homo sapiens."

                                   When does a member of the human species also count as a person? To answer that question Singer develops the teachings of the philosophers John Locke and Joseph Fletcher, whom he rightly refers to as the forefathers of this view, saying, "I propose to use [the term] 'person', in the sense of a rational and self-conscious being" (

                                 To counter some of Singer's ideas, last year I wrote and presented a paper contrasting the idea of human suffering as described by Pope John Paul II with that of Peter Singer. I sent the paper to Singer, and to my surprise he wrote back. Although his response was cordial, and in some respects helpful, ultimately it was disappointing. Singer's views often elicit strong negative emotions in those who disagree with him. Yet his writing style makes it difficult to pin down the reasons why his conclusions are wrong; I hope to identify some of those reasons here.

                                 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), Professor Singer criticized Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta because she described her love for others as love for each of a succession of individuals rather than as "love for mankind merely as such." "If we were more rational," he says, "we would use our resources to save as many lives as possible, irrespective of whether we do it by reducing the road toll or by saving specific, identifiable lives" (p. 157). His idea seems to be that since Blessed Teresa was not, for example, spending her energy calculating auto accident rates against various speed limit options, she was irrational, because in doing so she could help more people.

                                 Yet, there is a difference between the love of Blessed Teresa for each person she met and the love Singer calls "love of mankind." Let's call Blessed Teresa's love, "love of the individual." Love of the individual involves a one-to-one relationship based on an attitude of care and respect that demands your full attention before moving on to the next person. "Love of mankind," on the other hand, is not a focus on one individual, but rather on the sum total of all people.

                                 Singer's view implies that face-to-face relationships sap time and energy that could be put to better use in lowering the overall suffering of mankind. This idea tends to separate individual people from suffering so you can get a measurable thing called "overall suffering." After that, you do whatever it takes to decrease suffering, even if it sometimes means killing an innocent person.

                                 Of course, Blessed Teresa also wanted the overall suffering of humanity to be reduced, but she never tried to achieve that goal by killing someone. In fact, she believed that in addition to the terrible violation of the individual killed, doing so would inevitably lead to more suffering in the long run.

                               , September 6, 1999). Singer's mother had reached a point in her life where she no longer recognized Singer, his sister, or her grandchildren, and she had lost the ability to reason. In this state, according to Singer's theory, she did not meet the definition of a person. According to his ethical theory, she ought to have been killed or left to die. Certainly no money should have been spent on her care, since the money could be better spent lowering the suffering of the greatest number of other people. Instead, Singer and his sister hired a team of home health-care aides to look after their mother, spending tens of thousands of dollars in the process.

                                 What's fascinating is that it is precisely when Singer gets into the position of reuniting suffering with a specific individual person, one whom he loves, that he reverses—in his actions—what he insists upon in his books.

                                 Many people have asked Singer about this contradiction between his behavior and his theory, and in many of those instances he has responded in ways consistent with his theory. Yet, when Michael Specter pressed him on the point, Singer said, "I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult... Perhaps it is more difficult than I thought before, because it is different when it's your mother." (

                                 The difference, when the sufferer is your mother, is that you love her. And it is love that opens our eyes to the true source of the worth of persons: their inner preciousness, unrepeatability, and uniqueness. It is precisely a glimpse of the unrepeatable uniqueness of another human person that inspires love. Once this glimpse is achieved and love springs forth in the soul

                                 Of course, some people believe it's merciful to kill someone who is in pain; that, however, is not love, but abandonment and murder. The request to be killed is actually a plea for two basic things: to be loved and to find pain relief. As soon as a person feels loved and/or has their pain managed, they no longer ask to be killed (and they're grateful that their request was not heeded). Pain is the trump card used by pro-euthanasia activists to promote their cause, but in our high-tech world we have the ability to eliminate this reason for the request to be killed. As for the other reason—feeling like an unloved nuisance

                                 It's very important to point out that while the love you have for someone is one reason why you would never kill him, it isn't the deepest reason. The deepest reason is the inner worth of the person. Your love for him is inside of you, but his humanity, uniqueness, and preciousness are inside of him. When you love someone you can more clearly see his inner worth. The person has this inner worth whether or not you love him, so no one should kill him—but unless love is in the picture you might have trouble knowing about his inner worth.

In the article he defends his theories against those who would use his behavior to refute them. The many people who wrote against Singer said, in effect: "Look, you didn't follow your rules when it came to your own mother, doesn't that mean your rules are wrong?" Paraphrasing, his answer is basically this: "No, that doesn't mean my rules are wrong, it only means that I disobeyed them in the case of my mother, and acted unethically."

Then I would be doing wrong in spending it on my mother, just as I do wrong when I spend, on myself or my family, money that could do more good if donated to an organization that helps people in much greater need than we are. I freely admit to not doing all that I should; but I could do it, and the fact that I do not do it does not vitiate the claim that it is what I should do" (p. 29).

                                 These questions and the contradictions in Singer's thought are important, but even they don't approach the real problem, expressed in the following question: Why can't Singer take the step from his experience with his mother to see that Blessed Teresa's way of life is the most rational? She acted in the same way he did towards his mother with every person she met. Her noble effort never to abandon anyone springs from an insight that Singer rejects over and over again: No person is replaceable, and no person ever loses his worth. Love, which clarifies the vision of the beloved, is an experience common to believers and non-believers alike, and so even though Singer is an atheist, these insights, which guided Blessed Teresa's life, are available to him through his experience with his mother.

                               In addition, since utilitarian ethics allows for the killing and abandonment of individual persons to achieve its stated goal of reducing overall suffering, it has actually doomed itself to failure from the outset. The link between the legalization of euthanasia and large-scale killing is not correctable through "guidelines," but follows from an inner and unavoidable logic. Not only has large-scale killing followed on the coattails of legalized euthanasia historically, but the logical connection between the two can also be demonstrated. I would formulate that reason like this: To kill or abandon one single human person, is in a certain sense just as horrible as killing or abandoning thousands. Since persons are irreplaceably precious, killing one of them represents an infinite crime, and so killing many is not a "greater" evil in a quantitative sense, such that when you reach a certain number, say 100,000, only then does immorality kick in.

                                 Despite his experience with his mother, Singer has yet to admit this in his writing. His answer—that he did wrong when he cared for his mother, as one of my students, Maria Scarnecchia, put it, "excuses his action, but does not express the motive for it." His critics are looking for that motive, and so I will suggest one: He did not kill his mother because he loves her, and this love made him see the reasons within her being for which she should not be killed.

                               I won't defend Dr. Singer on any of his positions as I consider them outlandish and pure tripe. However, I will say this: I feel that the title, or the subtitle of this article is misleading. Singer doesn't say that those he considers 'non-persons' should be killed, but rather they can be killed without it being unethical. This position is still utterly bogus, but it's not as if Singer is advocating straight homocide.

                               QuoteDr. Peter Singer, a tenured professor of the Center for Human Values at Princeton University, is one of the world's most famous and influential philosophers.You're confusing being published with being influential. Singer gets published a lot because he produces what the publishers are looking for -- no other explanation. His ideas are neither original, nor that intelligently developed. He basically serves the function of manipulating vulnerable minds and agitating non-vulnerable minds.

                               Thank you, Dr. Colosi, for this excellent article. I almost didn't read it, because Singer's views--and the fact that people reward him with a unversity chair or what have you--make me so very angry. But I'm glad I did read it. Somehow it makes me feel a bit better to know he couldn't off his own mother, and even a bit is something. Too bad he hasn't seemed to learn anything from that experience. Let's pray for him.

                               Reading this article reminds me of Pope John Paul's analysis of Capitalism and Communism in his 1983 Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis (On Concern for the Social Order). He spoke about Capitalism's economic ethic as one which subsumed the rights of the common good to individualism and noted Communism as a force which subsumed the dignity of the human person to the collective. I see little difference between Communism and Singer's philosophy. On paper, it is heartless, but in reality, no ideology can wipe out the fact that made in the Trinity's image and likeness, we find fulfillment in self-giving love. I do know that when the call went out to the world's bishops for submissions on issues to be addressed at the Second Vatican Council, Bishop Karol Wojtyla -who had witnessed the atrocities of the Communist and Nazi regimes- expressed his concern for humanity's failure to contemplate the face of Christ in the human person. For him, humanity was in desperate need of recovering this reverence for human dignity in each and every person. Without it, Western civilization cannot survive. When Pope John Paul returned to Poland after the fall of Communism, he was deeply pained to see his fellow Poles buying into Capitalism's empty promises of happiness based on self-centered consumerism that was suppplanting the deeply religious values of Poland's culture, and chastised them for it out of love, saying "you are my brothers, my sisters, my mother!" Clearly, here was someone who could identify deeply with each and every one, not just as fellow citizens, but as family. I pray that one day, Dr. Singer will wake up to recognize the law of love written by Love on his and on every human heart, and learn to see his brother, sister and mother in each and every person as well. As this article so well states, only a civilization of love, that grows in human hearts can truly counter the emptiness of this kind of Utilitarianism.

Never mind that Singer broke all of his own rules when his mother became ill with Alzheimer’s disease.
