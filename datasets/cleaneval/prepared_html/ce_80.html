     Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged perspectivesupon what is possible may lead to the realization that what has been takento be fundamental within a subject is not really fundamental; or at least,that the foundations--or supposed foundations--of the subject are not asfree of assumptions, problems, inelegant features, superfluous elements,discrepancies, idiosyncratic aspects, etc as has been thought.

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences morescientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by rectifying, enlarging,and extending the foundations of these subjects.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering someunsuspected category of being that is more fundamental than either ideasor things, or that transcends what is meant by both the "mental" and "physical''aspects of reality.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon basic scales--asof duration, time, Population, importance, complexity, or entropy--ideonomycan call the mind's attention to what is only naturally the most and leastfundamental in a subject, to the way in which things derive their greateror lesser fundamentality from one another, to the direction in which thatwhich is truly or most fundamental is apt to be found, or to the propertiesthat fundamentals or foundations are likely to or must have.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impairedby a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define, characterize,or emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final topic, concept, phenomenon,substance, law, entity, goal, or the like of the subject (or the set ofsuch things). Then again, the supreme topic or whatever may have some terribleunsolved problem or difficulty associated with it.

   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch concernof sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is in flux, the essentialnature or defining properties of life are unknown to the science of life(or to biology), and even the basic object of study of mathematics (itcannot be

     , as hinted above, may not be sufficientlyfundamental) is mysterious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more fundamentalways, and it has already been used to define life, or to reduce it to aset of ninety-two fundamental properties. The set of 8,464 possible dyadiccombinations of the primary properties have demonstrated such extraordinaryinterest that they promise to revolutionize theoretical biology, somethingwhich at once illustrates the importance of clarifying fundamentals andsuggests that the traits that were used to define the phenomenon of "life"were indeed fundamental.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also highlightedthe problems that plague all efforts to resolve fundamentals or to getat the genuine foundations of a subject; for it was found that the sameset of ninety-two basic properties of "life" have either analogs or exactequivalents in the supposedly inanimate phenomena of subjects other thanbiology. Thus forms or analogs of procreation, natural selection, and evolutioneither may or do exist in fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,and cosmology. The implication may variously be that life is not limitedor peculiar to biology, that life must be otherwise defined or definedvia other properties, that the essential phenomena of biology should includemore than organisms, or that biology should be recast into a superscienceincorporating many other sciences or that--like mathematics--applies toall science.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by improving,formalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just now emergingway, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means the form of thoughtitself. Ideonomy can help with both of these approaches, particularly inconjunction with computer software and hardware.
