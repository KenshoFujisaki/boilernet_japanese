     The PLP proceeds from thepremise that major political, electoral and constitutional reforms are longoverdue in Australia and that they are not and will not be tackled by the majorparties. In developing a blueprint for change we prioritise an order in thechange process on the basis of urgency and achievability. Therefore, whatfollows is an ambit package, eg. proportional representation for all Parliamentsis high on the list, followed by the abolition of state upper houses, followedby the creation of a two-tier structure of elected government. Depending on thechanging preferences of the Australian people some stages may be speeded up,collapsed or skipped altogether. What we present here is an overall concept forchange.

    PLP policy isaimed at creating the Maximalist Republic, a Republic for the people, by thepeople and of the people - as it should be! A mere change of ceremonial Head ofState would still leave Australia with a rigid and archaic constitution, anoutmoded political system and a grossly unequal society. This would be piecemealtinkering of the worst kind. The time has come to consider clear alternatives tothe federal form of government, the two-party system, the electoral system andthe scope of government. A Bill of Rights, constitutional protection of theenvironment and a conciliatory settlement of indigenous rights need to beincorporated in a Republican constitution.

     The notion thata government can be enterprising - and enabling - itself is the antithesis ofthe view that only private enterprise can deliver economic recovery, jobs andfuture prosperity for Australia. Many other countries, even those with asignificant private sector, have entirely government-owned or jointly-ownedpublic corporations to run key industries, e.g. France and Norway. As the PLP isof the view that Australia should aim at government enterprise rather thanprivatisation it becomes imperative to build real quality and independence intothe Government and Parliaments and to ensure that Government and Parliamentscease to be the servants of powerful multinational corporations and financiersin the private sector.

     The kind of question whichAustralians are now increasingly increasingly asking themselves in relation tothe Republic is: What kind of a Republic do we really want? If Australians canreconstruct their political system to meet the demands of a society vastlydifferent from Federation in 1900, having greatly advanced technology at itsdisposal and possessing superior transport and communication systems as well asphysical resources, how will they do it? Would there still be any need for afederal system at all? Or would it be a huge hindrance to effective government?Would there still be need a for some 830 politicians? Should they introduce atwo-tiered system of elected Government and enable the majority party orcoalition to select the Ministry from outside Parliament rather than appointcareer politicians? Surely the issue is no longer whether Australia should be aRepublic OR continue to be an outpost of a rather shaky constitutional monarchywhich has little interest in her distant Dominion. Improving the processes ofGovernment in Australia, steeped in 200 years British colonial and Westminstertraditions, is a task habitually avoided by both major parties. Unless it's doneAustralia may no longer in business on account of its antiquated constitutionand political system. More likely it will be governed by the Boards of Directorsof foreign Multi National Enterprises through a comprador class of well-paidcompliant Australian managers and politicians. That trend is unmistakablealready. The PLP intends to create a real democracy in Australia.

     The domination by two majorparties has led to an erosion of democracy and to a weakening of Government,often described as "the passing of Parliament". The electoral systemhas kept that now sterile, male dominated, two-party system in place for far toolong. A greater variety of interests, persons and cultures should be representedin the National Parliament. The role of the citizens in constitutional changehas been minimal and tokenistic. The initiative and timing of referendums is theprerogative of the Government of the day. Almost every constitutional referendumturns into a political slanging match regardless of the merits of the proposal(s).Only eight of many such referendums have been successful over the 100 years offederation. The rejection of the four proposals of the 1988 referendumdemonstrated the present Constitution's dangerous inflexibility once again.Updating the Constitution has proven to be far too difficult. The result hasbeen to devise expensive ways to circumvent it, often unsuccessfully, a recipefor stagnation and deterioration.

     The PLP'sanswer to these problems is that the piecemeal tinkering must end. Australiansneed to rewrite the entire constitution. The idea that the constitution cannotbe replaced by another one, supposedly because it can only be amended (and thenonly in terms of the highly unsatisfactory amending clause, section 128), is nomore than a legal fiction. It suggests that the legal system ultimately rulesAustralia rather than the people. This line of argument, frequently voiced byso-called constitutional experts, suggests that today's Australians are shackledby past agreements among some of the citizens who voted on the 1900 ConstitutionDraft in a VOLUNTARY referendum 100 YEARS AGO.

     The PLP greatly favours the strengthening of local government, both interms of funding and functions. In order to effectively extend functionscritical mass needs to be achieved and some smaller local government units wouldneed to be amalgamated. Certain functions which are now the domain of stategovernments will be transferred to local government of sufficient size andcapacity to handle them. In addition, the PLP will introduce the precinct (orward) system to ensure maximum community involvement in local government - andgenerally promote grassroots democracy in every way possible.

     In 1900 an excellent case could be made for a federal structure. A lot haschanged since then. Communications and transport systems have improveddramatically. In 2000 a country of only 19 million people does not need afederal structure, seven different administrations plus that of the NorthernTerritory and ACT. All the reasons for federation have long disappeared!

     As a first step the PLP advocates the abolition of the state upper houses bymeans of state referendums - assuming that our priority No. 1, the introductionof PR for state lower houses, has first been achieved. This would then befollowed by a campaign to abolish the states altogether.

     It is desirable that the Constitution has a link with the old one andprovides continuity in spite of introducing radical changes. Many newConstitutions of national states have been the outcome of great political and/orsocial upheavals, major crises such as wars, a struggle for independence, civilunrest and secession. However, this does not mean that states which are notsubject to such major crises (a) therefore have no need for major changes to theground rules of their governmental system; (b) that such changes as are neededcannot be achieved in a civil, democratic and peaceful manner. After all majorcrises are almost always the result of inadequate, evolutionary adjustment.

     Moreover, the notion that Australia is free from crisis at present would bechallenged by many and denied only by the ultra conservative and foolhardy. Ithas become a very unequal country in recent decades with many pressing socialissues. In economic terms Australia is struggling to maintain its independenceand achieve greater competitiveness. International capital is increasinglydictating her destiny. Australia's present Constitution and political system hassevere constraints which, the PLP maintains, cannot be remedied by ineffectualpiecemeal tinkering at the margins.

     The principal problem in having a constitutional referendum accepted has beenthe requirement laid down in Section 128 that , apart from a national majority,there has to be "majority in a majority of states". Clearly thisrepresents a bias in favour of the federal system itself. In order to alleviatethis problem, an undemocratic feature of the present Constitution the cause ofmuch rigidity and expense, the following strategy is recommended:
