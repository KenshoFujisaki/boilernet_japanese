              It was only a few months ago that Beacon Hill lawmakers, worried about financial crises overseas and a spate of local layoffs, were talking about belt-tightening, hoarding cash, and boosting the state's rainy day fund in anticipation of a recession that some seemed certain was just over the horizon.

              Governor Paul Cellucci produced the largest budget ever filed in Massachusetts history containing plans to lower the income tax rate and heap millions of dollars on pet projects and programs. Weeks later he said he wanted to spend another $300 million from a projected state surplus on one-time road and bridge improvements.

              Even before Cellucci got the spending bug, Speaker Thomas M. Finneran unveiled an ambitious and expensive plan to offer public preschool and full-day kindergarten. And Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham cited the surging economy as a reason to sharply increase the minimum wage.

              Despite the spending euphoria, economists are still nervous about the not-too-distant future. They say fewer jobs will be created. The financial service sector could be hit by a stock market crash. And consumer confidence may wane.

              "One way or another, the economy is going to slow in '99," says Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. "It doesn't have to go down the tubes like it did a decade ago.... A recession is unlikely and Massachusetts wouldn't do any worse than the rest of the country in terms of job loss and how long it stayed down, but the fact that we haven't had a slowdown yet means people should be more cautious, not less cautious."
