     Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered world)
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     and how (to what extent) he overcame them.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which destroyed
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak,
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand the
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     way to speak, read and write.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other objects
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     of the positioning of his body's parts.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     bewildered.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going to
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands;
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     reach out and touch things in his room.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a blindfolded
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     orientation.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     associate words with them but he could only remember these for a couple
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     that he couldn't read out of his right eye.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read, that
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     `brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     `brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     sentences.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer towards
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     the end of his journal.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue.

     If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example,
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     rest of his world.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd forget
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things he
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     recognised them.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     a way that a young child would.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still annoy
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space'
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     settlement.
    </span>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at the
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life
    </span>
    <br/>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     which had no real end.
