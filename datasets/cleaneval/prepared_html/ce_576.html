         Interestingly, it is by examining Eriksson's lowest point in charge, the defeat against Brazil in Japan, which fires the optimism for Portugal.

         Michael Owen, despite scoring, was carrying a hamstring problem that killed his pace. It was that game that taught him to embark on a gruelling weights programme that would clear up that injury. And it has.

         There is a long time to go, and a lot more drama to unfold. But if these five men - Eriksson, Owen, Beckham, Gerrard and Rooney - perform at their best next summer, then England will be the team to fear.

         England will not be the most technically-gifted team out there, but as the Germans consistently show, why worry about that when you have a coach, a system, a few world-class players and luck. And who is luckier than Eriksson?
