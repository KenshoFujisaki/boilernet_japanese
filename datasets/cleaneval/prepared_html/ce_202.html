      Lambs had been used in the OldCovenant for many years as sacrifices to obtain healing and forgiveness. Now the Messiah,though perfect, would himself suffer death as the one sacrificial lamb for Israel and thewhole world, that finally all might be forgiven and restored from death. Through breakingthe Mosaic law, the nation of Israel died, and their Law showed them why they died asindividuals. They were a people typified by a broken cross. Their only hope lay in themercy of God bringing about a new creation. Then came the next stage in their spiritualeducation, the grace of the New Covenant, but Israel had to learn first the need of aSaviour before they would accept him and be in a position to teach the other nations toway of life.

      . During the days of England under theCross of St. George, there commenced the abandonment of idolatry, and the start of theProtestant Reformation. In the days of the Union between England and Scotland, there camethe deeper spiritual awakening in the Wesleyan revivals. Then, under the completed UnionJack, there commenced the world-wide ministry of the Anglo-Saxon Missionary and BibleSocieties. This was accompanied by a fuller Gospel including the truth of the secondadvent of Christ, while to-day the Gospel of the Kingdom is being crowned by theAnglo-Israel awakening, and the outpouring of the Spirit.

      Parallel with this progressivereturn of Anglo-Saxon Israel to the God of their fathers, there has taken place thepromised multiplication and expansion of the race over the earth to form theEphraim-British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Manasseh-American Great Republic.

But most important of all, England defeated the Spanish Armada, which gave herdominion of the sea, the sure foundation of England's future greatness. In the nextperiod, under the elementary Union Jack, 1606 to 1800, the British Empire was born by theconquest of India and Canada, and by the annexation of eastern Australia; while the UnitedStates emerged by the Declaration of Independence. Then the third and final period underthe completed Union Jack, 1801 to 1941+ has witnessed the full development of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations and the great Republic of the United States of America.
