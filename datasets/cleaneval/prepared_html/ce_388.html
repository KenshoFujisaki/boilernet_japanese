                     Rapid ascent to high altitude overtaxes the body's ability to tolerate the decreasing availability of oxygen. The cerebral forms of altitude illness appear to be due to hypoxia-induced changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, which results in a vasogenic brain edema.

                     ... the disease is thought to be caused by patchy hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (likely due to local shunting response to hypoxia) with consequent localized overperfusion combined with hypoxic permeability of pulmonary capillary walls. These changes result in high pulmonary artery pressure, high permeability, and leak into the alveoli. HAPE is quite distinct from other forms of pulmonary edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

As with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), recovery is usually complete, although, even with proper treatment (i.e., oxygen, prompt descent), a small percentage of very ill patients die. Patients who recover have rapid clearing of edematous fluid and do not develop fibrosis or other long-term sequelae.

                     HAPE occurs in the context of a recent ascent to altitudes higher than about 2500 m (8,200 ft). Additionally, patients often have a history of rapid ascent, with sleeping elevations increased by more than 300 m (1,000 ft) per night above 3000 m (9,800 ft). Patients frequently lack the spontaneous diuresis normally seen at altitude.

Contrary to popular belief, your ability to perform at higher altitude is tied less to your physical condition, and tied more to your genetic stock. Certain medical conditions such as asthma and high blood pressure can be aggravated by altitude. If you use a little common sense and do some preparation, you will find that you will be able to perform most outdoor activities all the way to 15,000 feet with little discomfort and medical problems.

People who have cardiopulmonary disorders may have serious problems in this altitude range and should consult a physician before visiting or engaging in outdoor sporting activity.

Not only is AMS a possibility, but the risk of HAPE or High Altitude Pulmonary Edema greatly increases over 12,000 feet. To put this in proper perspective, private pilots who fly over 10,000 feet are required to use supplemental oxygen. Most people that do mountaineering will climb in these altitudes. Pregnant women, children under the age of two, and people who have cardiopulmonary disorders should not go above 10,000 feet in altitude. Serious medical complications can occur in this range.

AMS, HAPE, and HACE or High Altitude Cerebral Edema can all be experienced in this altitude range.

                     Altitude above 18,000 feet is also called, “the death zone.” As the air pressure falls to as low as 7 psi, the body, even with supplemental oxygen literally starts to die. The severe onset of HAPE and HACE can occur at these altitudes and AMS symptoms are almost continuously experienced. Only highly experienced mountaineers should venture into these altitudes, and a constant vigil has to be made for HAPE and HACE symptoms, with a focus on HACE symptoms as part of the symptoms for HACE is clouded judgment.

                      During prolonged exercise, and at higher altitudes, blood cell changes produce reduced capillary efficiency, particularly in the lungs, liver, and spleen and reduced ability to carry and transfer oxygen to peripheral tissues. This induces an anaemia of iron deficiency by rupture of the red blood cells in the capillaries, under the effect of the rise in the cardiac flow and the blood pressure.

                      For altitudes over 2000 m and for high endurance activities, a supplementation of 250 g of omega-3 fish oils 3 to 5 times per week ( = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) is beneficial. To avoid a vitamin E deficiency from arising from the exercise and the additional polyunsaturated fatty acids, a supplementation with vitamin E is required. These changes will provide for better performance.

                           Release of mercury from cellular binding can be enhanced by remaining at an altitude of 1800 to 2000 metres (5,800 to 6,400 feet) for a period of not less than 1 week with an early daily fluctuation by travel down to 0 to 100 metres and return within 4 to 6 hours. The early fluctuations encourage greater permeability of the cell wall for the release of mercury and other toxins. Living at the reduced pressure altitude facilitates the release of these toxins from the cells.
