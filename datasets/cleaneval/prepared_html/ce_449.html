He said that, �If you have seen me, then you�ve seen the Father. I and the Father are one.� (John 10:30) That�s the reason there is so much conflict over his identity, that�s the reason men and women have debated for centuries about who Jesus is.

That�s why there�s so much controversy, because the claims of Jesus in the Bible leave us with only two options. We either believe his claim or we reject it, and everyone must decide for themselves whether Jesus really is God.

               The notion of God being born in a stable is more than they can get their mind around, so many simply label him as a great religious teacher and dismiss his claim to divinity. And it�s true, Jesus was a great teacher. The ethical teachings of Jesus are without equal, �Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.� (Matthew 7:12) His Sermon on the Mount is recognized by Christians and non-Christians alike as one of the most brilliant moral essays in all of history.

A great moral educator wouldn�t allow others to believe that he was God and encourage them to rely upon him for salvation if it wasn�t true. A good teacher would present the truth and give his students help in this life, not fill their heads with nonsense about the forgiveness of sin through his death and resurrection.

(Luke 19), praise due only to God. So we�re boxed into a corner, because we all know that a great moral teacher wouldn�t knowingly lie to people about his identity. So he�s either God, just as he claimed, or he was a brilliant liar, but he can�t be both.

That�s a little hard to believe. In fact, I find it harder to believe in his success as a liar than in his claim to deity. The liars theory just doesn�t make sense to me. Small lies aren�t easy to cover up; imagine covering the grandest of lies, a claim to divinity. On top of that, imagine large crowds following you around for 3 years listening to your teaching and religious scholars scrutinizing your every word and working to try and trap you so that they can discredit you. Imagine how hard it would have been to spin a lie that elaborate and not get caught. How could he have kept it all straight without being found out or just collapsing under the shear weight of the criticism?

               to me because Jesus doesn�t have a liars M.O. (modus operandi). Liars, especially of this magnitude, are inconsistent and confusing, because they are constantly having to back track and adjust the story to fit reality. Yet nothing about what Jesus has to say sounds like double speak. While liars always have to spin the truth, one of the most notable elements of Jesus� character is his brazen honesty. Even while hanging on the cross, he remains perfectly consistent in his message, promising to meet the thief hanging next to him in paradise. Liars don�t act like this. Liars coerce and connive and manipulate, so that they don�t end up on a cross.

He�s crazy and no one doubts it, but Jesus demonstrated perfect emotional balance and health, even in the face of some of life�s worst ordeals. If you or I have a bad day at work, then we�re tempted to take it out on the family, the slightest bit of pressure in our lives causes us to act out, we buckle under the pressure and our behavior changes accordingly.

               and pressing him to simply change his story and give up his claim to deity, Jesus refuses and appears unflappable as his life hangs in the balance. In fact, while others would have snapped in anger and bitterness at being betrayed by friends and falsely accused Jesus responds in kindness, considering the needs of others. On the cross he cries out Father forgive them because they don�t understand what they are doing. Then he spots his mother in the crowd, while he�s hanging on the cross and he calls out to his friend John, who is also looking on, and asks that he would take care of her after he�s gone. Jesus is anything but crazy, unless you consider kindness and mercy in the face of mistreatment and torture crazy.

Jesus was crucified because the religious elite were threatened by the credibility of his claim and the obvious sanity in his personality, which they felt were a threat to their power. If you remember, the Roman authority Pilate washed his hands of the whole thing, not wanting to be implicated in the wrongful death of an innocent man, but too politically savvy to disappoint the Jews.

               be a liar because a liar would do his best to avoid crucifixion and Jesus willingly dies for us. Jesus can�t possibly be crazy either because crazy people buckle under pressure, especially the type of pressure he experienced. The only answer available to the question �Who is this Jesus?� is that he is God. The prophet Isaiah was right, this is Immanuel, �God with us.� And as hard as it can be to get our finite minds to understand the infinite reality of God dieing on a cross for us, that is the power of the Christian message. And if you have never opened your life to God, then I want to encourage you to pray and receive his Jesus. The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the gift of God to mankind. Don�t refuse the gift. It�s a simple prayer saying, God I�ve recognize your coming as baby to this earth and your death and resurrection for me as a gift. I receive your gift. Thank You.
