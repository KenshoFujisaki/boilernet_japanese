            Staying independent is very important to people with sight problems, as is getting support when needed. Community care services have been put in place to provide this support. So, if you are having difficulties because of sight problems, here we explain what community care means for you – what you can ask for from social services, what services might be available and how you can get these. As well as a guide to who’s who in social services, there are useful telephone numbers you can use for further information.

           <span __boilernet_label="1">
            Community care, provided by your local council’s social services department, aims to support people with disabilities and other special needs to lead independent lives. For example, an older person with a sight problem might need help with their shopping and adaptations to their home. Someone with a severe disability might need regular support from carers to help them to continue to live at home.

            There is some variation in the amount of support that different councils offer. So it is a good idea to ask your council for information about community care and services for people with sight problems.

            Your council should then provide information in a format that is best for you. Tell them if you prefer information in large print, on tape or in braille, or need help because you have difficulty with communication. You may ask for a translation or an interpreter if English is not your first language.

Social Services should also check regularly that the services are meeting your needs, and that everything is going well.

            - 10-year-old Brandon is registered blind. At school he doesn't get access to the same choice of books as sighted children. His mum says: "It's not the fault of the teachers. It's the fact that many of the books he likes to read are not available in braille or audio. I'd like the Government to act now. If the situation doesn't improve, I'm worried that as he gets older, Brandon won't receive the books he needs.â€?
