          Concentrations in Welsh rivers of the main plant nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) are generally much lower than those found in the midlands and south-east England. There are correspondingly fewer perceived problems associated with eutrophication compared with lowland England. However, nutrient enrichment arising from sewage inputs and agriculture does cause water quality problems in all types of aquatic environment, affecting drinking water supplies, conservation interests and recreational uses.

Eutrophication is affecting the survival of two endangered fish species: the gwyniad in Llyn Tegid and the arctic charr in Llyn Padarn.

          Historical records indicate that algal blooms in coastal waters have been a periodic natural occurrence. However, the concentration of blooms of Phaeocystis between Liverpool Bay and the Menai Strait in north Wales, around Aberystwyth and in Carmarthen Bay suggest an influence of enhanced nutrient inputs in these areas arising from sewage, agricultural run-off and industrial discharges. Concentrations of nutrients and algae in the Irish Sea have risen steadily since the 1960s, so this problem appears to be increasing. Foams and scums arising from blooms are aesthetically unpleasant, can be mistaken for sewage and give rise to numerous public complaints over bathing water quality.

In freshwater these are fish-or insect-eating aquatic birds and aquatic mammals, such as otters, and in the marine environment seals, porpoises, dolphins and seabirds are at greatest risk.

Previously it had been assumed, in accordance with other studies, that concentrations in fish would be similar to that of ambient seawater. The finding that tritium could be bioaccumulated required a reassessment of the radiation dose to the critical group of fish consumers in Cardiff, and the 1997 figure of 3% has been revised to 6%. This is still a small proportion of the dose limit but nevertheless the unexpected bioaccumulation of tritium was of concern and resulted in a requirement for tritium discharges to be reduced significantly (see
