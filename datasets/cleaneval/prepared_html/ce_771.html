               Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Distinguished Members of the Council, it's a great pleasure to be here with you again to consider this very important matter.  And I'm very pleased to be here as the Secretary of State of a relatively new country on the face of the earth, but I think I can take some credit sitting here as being a representative of the oldest democracy that is assembled here around this table.

               I'm proud of that.  A democracy that believes in peace, a nation that has tried in the course of its history to show how people can live in peace with one another, but a democracy that has not been afraid to meet its responsibilities on the world stage when it has been challenged; more importantly, when others in the world have been challenged or when the international order has been challenged or when the international institutions of which we are a part have been challenged.

               I am glad that access has been relatively good.  But that is all process; it is not substance.  I am pleased to hear that decrees have now been issued that should have been issued years and years ago.  But does anybody really think a decree from Saddam Hussein, directed to whom, is going to fundamentally change the situation?  And it comes out on a morning when we are moving forward down the path laid out by Resolution 1441.

               These are all process issues.  These are all tricks that are being played on us.  And to say that new commissions are being formed that will go find materials that they claim are not there in the first place, can anybody honestly believe that either one of these two new commissions will actively seek out information that they have been actively trying to deny to the world community, to the inspectors, for the last eleven plus years?

               I commend the inspectors.  I thank them for what they are doing.  But at the same time, I have to keep coming back to the point that the inspectors have repeatedly made, and they've made it again here this morning.  They've been making it for the last eleven plus years:  What we need is not more inspections, what we need is not more immediate access; what we need is immediate, active, unconditional, full cooperation on the part of Iraq.

               We had intense discussions.  All of you are familiar with it.  You participated in these discussions and it was about disarmament.  And the resolution began with the clear statement that Iraq was in material breach of its obligations for the past eleven years and remains to that day, the day the resolution was passed, in material breach.

               And the resolution said Iraq must now come into compliance.  It must disarm.  The resolution went on to say that we want to see a declaration from Iraq within 30 days of all of its activities.  Put it all on the table.  Let's see what you have been doing.  Give us a declaration that we can believe in that is full, complete and accurate.  That's what we said to Iraq on the 8th of November.  And some 29 days later we got 12,000 pages.  Nobody in this Council can say that that was a full, complete or accurate declaration.

               And now it is several months after that declaration was submitted, and I have heard nothing to suggest that they have filled in the gaps that were in that declaration or they have added new evidence that should give us any comfort that we have a full, complete and accurate declaration.

               You will recall, we put that declaration requirement into the resolution as an early test of Iraq's seriousness.  Are they serious?  Are they going to disarm?  Are they going to comply?  Are they going to cooperate?  And the answer with that declaration was, "No.  We're going to see what we can get away with.  We can see how much we can slip under your nose," and everybody will clap and say, "Isn't that wonderful?  They provided a declaration that was of not any particular use."

               We then had some level of acceptance of the fact inspectors would be going back in.  Recall that Iraq tried to use this gambit right after the President's speech in September to try to keep Resolution 1441 from ever coming down the pipe.

               Suddenly, on the following Monday after the President's speech, "Oh, we'll let inspectors back in."  Why?  Because when the President spoke and when Iraq saw that that the international community was now coming together with seriousness and with determination, it knew it better do something.  It didn't do it out of the goodness of its heart or it suddenly discovered that it's been in violation for all those years.  They did it because of pressure.  They did it because this Council stood firm.  They did it because the international community said, “Enough.”  We will not tolerate Iraq continuing to have weapons of mass destruction to be used against its own people, to be used against its neighbors."

               Or worse, if we find a post-9/11 nexus between Iraq and terrorist organizations that are looking for just such weapons -- and I would submit and will provide more evidence that such connections are now emerging and we can establish that they exist -- we cannot wait for one of these terrible weapons to show up in one of our cities and wonder where it came from after it's been detonated by al-Qaida or somebody else.  This is the time to go after this source of this kind of weaponry.  And that's what 1441 was all about.

               Force should always be a last resort.  I have preached this for most of my professional life, as a soldier and as a diplomat, but it must be a resort.  We cannot allow this process to be endlessly strung out as Iraq is trying to do right now-- string it out long enough and the world will start looking in other directions, the Security Council will move on, we'll get away with it again.

               My friends, they cannot be allowed to get away with it again.  We now are in a situation where Iraq's continued noncompliance and failure to cooperate, it seems to me, in the clearest terms, requires this Council to begin to think through the consequences of walking away from this problem with a reality that we have to face this problem; and that, in the very near future, we will have to consider whether or not we've reached that point where this Council, as distasteful as it may be, as reluctant as we may be, as many as -- there are so many of you who would rather not have to face this issue, but it's an issue that must be faced.  And that is whether or not it is time to consider serious consequences of the kind intended by 1441.

               The reason we must not look away from it is because these are terrible weapons.  We are talking about weapons that will kill not a few people, not a hundred people, not a thousand people, but that could kill tens of thousands of people if these weapons got into the wrong hands.
