             Three basic practices make the difference between a software project that succeeds and one that fails. These practices supportand reinforce each other; when done properly, they form an interlocking safety net to help ensure success and prevent commonproject disasters. However, few development teams in the United States use these proven techniques, and even fewer use themcorrectly.

             Many software projects that fail seemto fail for very similar reasons. Afterobserving � and helping � many of theseailing projects over the past couple ofdecades, it seems clear to us that a majorityof common problems can be tracedback to a lack of three very basic practices.Fortunately, these three practices are easyand relatively inexpensive to adopt. It doesnot require a large-scale, expensive, orbureaucratic effort; with just these practicesin place, your team can work at topspeed with increased parallelism. You willnever lose precious work, and you willknow immediately when the developmentstarts to veer off-track in time to correct it,cheaply and easily.

Hope is a pretty poormethodology, and these teams regularlylose precious work. Developers begin tofear making any changes at all, in case theyaccidentally make the system worse. Ofcourse, this fear becomes a self-fulfillingprophecy as necessary changes are neglectedand the system begins to degrade.

             Unit testing is a coding technique forprogrammers so they can verify that thecode they just wrote actually does somethingakin to their intent. It may or maynot fulfill the requirements, but that is aseparate question: If the code does not dowhat the programmer thought it did, thenany further testing or validation is bothmeaningless and a large waste of time andmoney (two items that are in short supplyto begin with). Developer-centric unittesting is a great way to introduce basicregression testing, create more modularizedcode that is easier to maintain, andensure that new work does not breakexisting work. Despite the effectiveness ofthis technique in both improving designand identifying and preventing defects(aka bugs), 76 percent of companies in theUnited States do not even try it [2].

             Automation is a catchall category thatincludes regular, unattended project builds,including regression tests and push-buttonconvenience for day-to-day activities.Regular builds ensure that the product canbe built to catch simple mistakes early andeasily, when fixing them is the cheapest.When implemented properly, it is as if youhave an ever-vigilant guardian looking overyour shoulder, warning you as soon asthere is a problem. Incredibly, some 70percent of projects in the United States donot have any sort of daily build [2]. By thetime they discover a problem, it has metastasizedinto a much larger and potentiallyfatal problem.

             When a programmer checks in code, itis now potentially available to the rest ofthe team. As such, it is only polite toensure that this new code actually compilessuccessfully; it should be accompanied byunit tests (more on this later), and thosetests should pass. All the other passingtests in the system should continue to passas well � if they suddenly fail, then you caneasily trace the failure to the new code thatwas introduced.

             You may find you can increase parallelismand efficiency in your team by usinga system that features optimistic locking.In these systems, multiple people can editthe same source code file simultaneously.The system uses conflict-resolution algorithmsto merge the disparate changestogether in a sensible manner. Ninety-ninepercent of the time it works perfectly withoutintervention. Occasionally, however,there is a conflict that must be addressedmanually. At no point is anyone's work indanger of being lost, and it ends up beingmuch more efficient to coordinate justthese few conflicts by hand instead of havingeveryone coordinate every change withthe rest of the team.

Withthe computer performing these checksregularly, developers do not have to.Problems can be identified as soon as theyhappen, and the appropriate developer orteam lead can be notified immediately ofthe problem [4]. Problems can be fixedquickly, before they have a chance to causeany additional damage. That is the benefitwe want from automation.

With this set of practices in place,developers can realistically try out a numberof different solutions to a problem:Version control will keep them separate,and unit testing will help confirm the viabilityof each solution. All this with plentyof automated support, including continuous,ongoing checks ensures that the teamdoes not wander too far off into thewoods.

             The first and most obvious area to test issimply to see if the expected results areright � to validate the results. These areusually the easy tests, as they represent theanswer to the key question: If the code rancorrectly, how would I know? Here is anexample of how being forced to thinkabout testing helps developers code better:If this question cannot be answered satisfactorily,then writing the code � or the test� may be a complete waste of time.

Ifthe requirements are truly not yet known,or not yet complete, you can always makesome assumptions as a stake in the ground.They may not be correct from the user'spoint of view (or anyone else on the planet),but they let the team continue to develop.And, because you have written a testbased on your assumption, you have nowdocumented it � nothing is implicit.

             One area that might prove beneficial toexamine is performance characteristics �not performance itself, but trends as inputsizes grow, as problems become morecomplex, and so on. Why? We have allexperienced applications that work fine fora year or so, but suddenly and inexplicablyslow to a crawl. Often, this is the result ofa silly error or oversight: A databaseadministrator changed the indexing structurein the database, or a developer typedan extra zero into a loop counter.

             What we would like to achieve is aquick regression test of performancecharacteristics. We want to do this regularly,every day at least, so that if we haveinadvertently introduced a performanceproblem we will know about it soonerrather than later (because the nearer intime you are to the change that introducedthe problem, the easier it is to workthrough the list of things that may havecaused that problem).

             So, to avoid shipping software withunsuspected performance problems,teams should consider writing some roughtests just to make sure that the performancecurve remains stable. For instance,suppose the team is working on a componentthat lets users browse the Web fromwithin their application. Part of therequirement is to filter out access to Websites that we wish to block. The codeworks fine with a few dozen sample sites,but will it work as well with 10,000?100,000? We can write a unit test to findout.

             This gives us some assurance that weare still meeting performance targets. Butbecause this one test takes six to sevenseconds to run, we may not want to run itevery time.
