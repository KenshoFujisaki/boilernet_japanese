        There are a lot of great marketing books and blogs out there. That being said, I still think the best marketing stories come from personal, first-hand experience.

        Here's a favorite one of mine:

        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Back when I lived in New York there was this fabulous, crazy-ass juice bar on West Houston called Lucky's Juice Joint. I think it's no longer there. I hear it's moved.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         It was the most out-of-place business south of 14th Street. Hard to descibe, except as a "hardcore hippie haven". Just had this weird, crazy, psychedelic-rainforest vibe.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         But damn, it had the best juice in town. It was amazing stuff. Tasted like the fruits and vegetables were picked that morning. Fresher than anything else I found in New York. And yes, I had searched high and low for even better alternatives, but never found one. In New York, this was really it.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The boss was this crazy looking tie-dye wearing guy who looked and talked like he had done too many drugs back in the 'sixties. A big ol' middle aged, acid-head teddy bear.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         One day we struck up a brief conversation. I complimented the hell out of his product.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         "Wow," I quietly gushed, "Your stuff is the best. It really is..."
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         "Sure it is," said the guy. "That's because we make it with reverence."

      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       You don't have to get a job with a famous company or hot-shot industry in order to have a spectacular career. You just have to do what you do with reverence.

       Worse than that, it doesn't have any business models that allow them to do what they do cheaply. They only have expensive models. All those mouths to feed, all those executive golf club memberships to pay for etc etc.

        You know that celeb on that TV show you watch? You know, the one with the fancy-schmancy lifestyle your long-sufferring wife spends all her time enviously reading about in the tabloids?

        That's right. From your paycheck. Her money comes from you. Because the money that pays for her TV appearances comes from advertisers, who get their money from you when you go to Wal-Mart and buy their products that you saw advertised on your celeb pal's TV show the night before.

         It's about what you think of the consumer, and how your product acts as a conduit to express that.

        It's 180 degrees from the Love Mark.The energy travels from the product (i.e. you) to the end user, not the other way around.

        Back in the 60s and 70s, Received Wisdom would say that a computer company should make both main bits of the machine- the hardware and software. IBM, Digital etc all followed this model.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        But 25 or so years ago Microsoft asked themselves one of the best questions ever in the history of business:
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        “If hardware was free, how would Microsoft make a living?”
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        They had seen the writing on the wall. They saw hardware (i.e. the white boxes and circuit boards that make up PCs) eventually becoming a commodity. They looked into the future, and saw the price do nothing but go down.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        And this was years before hardware became commodified. They decided software was where the action was; they’d let companies like Dell or Toshiba worry about the ever-commodifying molecules. They would just focus exclusively on the bit that would retain its value over time i.e. the software.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Apple didn’t spot this. Apple held on to hardware.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Apple nearly went under.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Microsoft became one of the biggest companies in the world.

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        So here’s my question to my fellow advertising folk, in the same vein:
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        “If they made advertising illegal overnight, how would your company make a living?”
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Seriously. Any fool company can come up with a decent campaign brief. Any fool company can produce an award-winning TV commercial.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        That’s no longer where the value is. Like computer hardware, that part of the business has become commodified. The real long-term, non-commodified value is elsewhere.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        So where’s the non-commodified part? Seriously.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        I have an idea. It's very exciting.

People remebered it more, somehow. So blank cards have always been "business cards" to me. Depends how you want to define it.

        Being a conventional advertising copywriter is also not it. Most copywriters are uninspired hacks with only a small bag of smartass tricks separating themselves and oblivion. Very few of them bring any seriously original thinking to their client’s problems. And very few clients ask copywriters for serious thinking as a result. They ask other people instead.

        This is the central message of the book. A lot of people daydream about living the creative life, about being a writer, artist, whatever, even if they don't really have anything to say or really want to do the actual work. This book is not for them. This book is for people who already have a few ideas of their own, who may already be well on their way, but maybe could use a wee push. It's not an instruction manual. It just shows where some of the land mines are buried, and gives direct and unapologetic advice on how to avoid stepping on them.

       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        It will be very different from the usual touchy-feely "Personal Creativity" fare. It'll have a bit more bite to it. It will not try to romantisize the creative life, nor try to convert people to living it. The aim is not to make the reader feel comforted, validated or make it all seem easier than it actually is. The main thesis of the book is just to get on with it; that only when one has dropped all those clichéd romantic daydreams about being creative, does the world actually start paying attention, do things actually start moving forward.

        I’m very interested in what is called “upstreaming”; one of those pesky buzzwords currently en vogue.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        “Upstreaming” basically means moving up the value chain.

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        As a cartoonist, a good definition would be “upstreaming” from selling $25 cartoons to newspapers, to selling million-dollar movie ideas based on your cartoon character. Or in my case, “upstreaming” from showing free cartoons on the net, to selling my advertising services to one of my readers who has a business needing sold to a large audience.

        The whole frickin’ advertising businesses is currently going through a turbulent upstreaming phase at the moment.

        A lot of the things ad agencies are used to selling to their clients are not nearly as rare or valuable as they once were. And the people in the cubes doing the work are finding themselves less and less valued.

        An art director I know was laid off from Ogilvy's in New York about 2 years ago. He’s had a very hard time. His current situation is a total disaster. He’s 40 years old. Before the layoff his career had been less than spectacular.

         Chess pieces move the way they do for a reason:
        </span>
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        A drunk Scottish guy in a pub told me this story. Fisk away.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Chess pieces are wee representations of ancient warfare.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        1. Pawns. Foot soldiers. They were ordered to advance, fight to the death, and never retreat. Manoeuvring a phalanx of them in any direction other than forwards was pretty much impossible until the advent of the highly trained, highly drilled professional soldier, which didn't appear until much later with the Romans.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        2. Knights. In ancient times, Calvary never advanced head on, but flanked i.e. they went around the back and attacked at the side.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        3. Rooks. The original chess rooks were not castles, but war elephants. Elephants are fairly unstoppable once they get going, but not very manoeuvrable. Hence they can go in straight lines- forward, backward, left, right- but little else. In ancient times war elephants carried little “castles” on their backs, from which archers would fire down (think Lord of the Rings). Europe has no elephants, but does have castles. So the latter caught on.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        4. Bishops. Chess predates Christianity in Europe. The original bishop pieces were actually sailing ships. Sailing ships never go straight, but tack to the left or right i.e. diagonal. The sail of the ship resembles the bishop’s crown. The bishops's crown was stylistically adopted in Europe during the Dark Ages, as Chistianity spread and naval warfare went into decline after the fall of the Roman Empire.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        5. The Queen. The Queen’s entourage was always looked after by a small, elite, highly trained bodyguard. The imperative to protect the women and children was very strong. If trouble was afoot it needed to get the hell out of Dodge very quickly. Ergo the bodyguard was very mobile and very deadly. It needed to be.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        6. The King, though powerful and free to choose any direction he wanted, was heavily laden with the apparatus of state. The King could not just drop everything and flee; he had the court, the treasury and the ministers weighing him down. So his movements were fairly limited.

        As a professional writer, I am interested in how conversation scales.

        How communication scales, x to the power of n etc etc.

        Ideally, if you’re in the communication business, you want to say the same thing, the same way to an audience of millions that you would to an audience of one. Imagine the power you’d have if you could pull it off.

        A startup I know just got big and sexy. Now the people doing the actual work are pissed off because suddenly the management are starting to believe their own publicity. Suddenly the fancy-talk consultants are moving in.

        A few years ago, the ad agency I worked for in New York was sold to

        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Euro RSCG,

        the international advertising conglomerate.

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        The week of the paper being signed, the entire agency was crowded into this big room, and the then CEO of Euro RSCG, Bob Schmetterer, our new boss, gave us this big pep talk. We were part of this big global future that was happening or whatever.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Fair enough. I kinda saw the vision. It made sense, sorta, at least from a senior management position. We grunts were less sure, but since when are grunts sure about anything senior management gets up to?

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        So Bob opened the floor to questions. Nobody really had any, which I thought was odd. So to break the awkward silence I raised my hand.

        “In time of great change,” I asked, “some things get harder, some things get easier, and the harder bit is usually where the money is. What's the hardest part of your job now?”

       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        In times of great change, some things get harder, some things get easier. Concentrate on the former, because that’s where the money is. I still use that thought with my clients today.

        I guess what interests me about any business is the hard parts. The easy parts are always overcrowded, underpaid and quietly dying.

        Go to any art opening, film screening or book launch in New York, Paris, London, Tokyo etc. The place is full of these people- artists killing time, drinking the free wine, working the room, trying to hide their fear and doubt, trying not to look desperate, trying to look like players, trying to feign relevance, trying to be as interesting and confident and amusing and networked as possible, all waiting around till their Big Yes Moment hopefully one day lands on their lap from an unknown direction. It doesn't matter if they're a 20-year-old art student or a 50-year-old Oscar Nominee. Their palpable unease carries the same vibe.

        Not that I ever belonged to the "Bill Gates is Satan" crowd. I never was into computers enough to really care whether a guy in Redmond wrote the code, or some guy in Toledo.

He just happens to work for Microsoft. Robert writes about his job and his company the same way I would if I worked for them and liked my job. Informal, informed, friendly, it gives real insight about his company where possible- he tries to be as open and insightful as he can without disclosing trade secrets.

        This is simply going to devistate Kryptonite. Too bad, I've always been a fan. Of course, this isn't principally a communication problem; it's a product problem. The only thing I could think that might save their business at this point would be a massive recall/refund for every customer with a U-lock. But this is also a communication problem. As a customer (I have four of their locks), I would really like to know whether this problem affect their other products, or whether it is limited to that Evolution 2000. But their communication on this sucks. The story broke online, yet there is nothing about it on their web site. They could really, really use a blog to try to contain the damage ASAP. But looking at their actions so far, I am not optimistic.

          The way to do that, obviously, is not to compare it with Citizen Kane. Better to realize that even a mediocre movie has a good story behind it- the combined results of millions of dollars and roomfulls of smart, driven people. Try to find the brightest people on the project and try to bring their energy in to the equation. Even if it's the worst movie ever, there might be some amazingly wonderful person working in the costume department or whatever. Try to tap into that side of things.

      <blockquote>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        These bundling strategies are not stable of themselves, they exist only within the context of technology, distribution and transaction costs surrounding them. When these change, bundles may collapse. The CD is the obvious example. With individual digitized songs now easier to duplicate and distribute than the physical bundle, the albums raison d'etre has disappeared. As the simple playlist replaces the album's remaining value of simplifying choice, CDs commence a slow glide to oblivion, moderated only by the installed base of equipment and consumer habit.

         If the network or the newspaper or the magazine or the cable system was the old bundle, the internet itself is the new bundle: In this medium of extreme control, we each put together whatever bundle we want...

         This accelerates the commoditization of content. It also provides opportunities for those who can add value (and convenience and perspective and even fun)... In this new distributed, unbundled, post-marketplace, molecular, commoditized media world, value can be added in many ways. It's about relationships. It's about relevancy. It's about service. It's about uniqueness. It's about perspective.

        We media/advertising/content folk are supposed to be "creative". Yet we're very uncreative when it comes to thinking about our business models differently.

Management knows we're screwed, knows we're stuck, knows we're desperate, so they squeeze harder. I would do the same. So would you.

        New Delhi. Thirteen September 2004. I awoke, jetlagged and sweaty, at 3A.M. I’d had a nightmare. Stark realism. I was, as usual, accused of overstatement and a few (or more) too many exclamation marks (!!!!!). Only this time I’d acceded to “They.” The “They” who believe in The Plan and Built to Last and Continuous Improvement and Quiet, Humble Leaders. No! No! I had failed, in my dream, to live up to my Fervent Beliefs! This must not pass! In a sweat, fearful that the time would not come ‘round again, I turned on the light, picked up a pad of paper, and began to scribble frantically. Herewith the result.

         Seth Godin's
        </span>
       </a>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        basic take on marketing. To him, there are only two questions worth asking:
       </span>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        1. Who’s talking about your product?
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        2. What are they saying?
       </span>
      </blockquote>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Two very simple questions. Both are hard as hell to answer honestly. Any kind of honesty is hard as hell. We’re hardwired to be deluded.
      </span>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Another gem from him:
       </span>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        "It’s all marketing now. The organizations that win will be the ones that realize that all they do is create things worth talking about."
       </span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Again, it's really simple stuff. But simple stuff often scares us.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        80% of one of my former client's business is word-of-mouth. I once argued the case that if we could double the amount of conversations people were having about the product, sales will go up by 60% (80% doubled equals 160%, i.e. a 60% increase etc).
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        So my team came up with some ideas that made it MUCH easier for customers to have random conversations about the product with other people. It wasn't rocket science, I assure you.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        She didn't buy the idea. She was shopping for rocket science that day, not plain speaking. Whatever.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Frankly, I think the idea of people actually talking about her product without her marketing team there to intervene like rabid pit bulls kinda terrified her.
       </span>

      </p>
      <p>

        So I exchange a few e-mails on the subject with Bob over in Tokyo. I remember Bob writing back something in particular about ad agencies- I don't even have to look it up, I can easily recite it from memory:

       <b>
       </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </b>
      </blockquote>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       There's the rub. Their business models do suck and they are indeed expensive for what you get. Bob is no fool.

        One thing about using the business card as a primary medium is the small size forces you to to think about what you're saying. You don't have the space to waffle or ramble. You cut to the chase. The drawing above is a pretty good example, I guess. It tells a lot of story in few words.

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        I can't tell you how useful this has proved to me professionally. In mass-market advertising, both space and airtime are very expensive. So every sentence you cut out saves thousands of dollars of your client's money.

      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        In a world of permanently fragmenting media, the market for "shorter" increases. The market for "longer" decreases. Artistically one could easily find that objectionable, but that doesn't change the actual market.

        Other, more famous and notable examples would be Jackson Pollack discovering splatter paint. Or Robert Ryman discovering all-white canvases. Andy Warhol discovering silkscreen. Hunter S Thompsonn discovering Gonzo Journalism. Duchamp discovering the Found Object. Jasper Johns discovering the American Flag. Hemingway discovering brevity.

        But it wasn't the format that made the art great. It was the fact that somehow while playing around with something new, suddenly they found themselves able to put their entire selves into it.

        Your job is no longer about selling. Your job is about firing off as many synapses in your client’s brain as possible.

      </p>

        The more synapses that are fired off, the more dopamines are released. Dopamines are seriously addictive. The more dopamines you release, the more the client will come back for more. Your client thinks he is coming back to you for sane, rational, value-driven reasons. He is wrong. He is coming back to feed.

         "How To Be Creative":

        Inspiration precedes the desire to create, not the other way around.
       </span>
      </blockquote>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       One of the reasons I got into drawing cartoons on the back of business cards was I could carry them around with me. Living downtown, you spend a lot of time walking around the place. I wanted an art form that was perfect for that.
      </span>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        So if I was walking down the street and I suddenly got hit with the itch to draw something, I could just nip over to the nearest park bench or coffee shop, pull out a blank card from my bag and get busy doing my thing. Seamless. Effortless. No fuss. I like it.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Before, when I was doing larger works, every time I got an idea while walking down the street I’d have to quit what I was doing and schlep back to my studio while the inspiration was still buzzing around in my head. Nine times out of ten the inspired moment would have past by the time I got back, rendering the whole exercise futile. Sure, I’d get drawing anyway, but it always seemed I was drawing a memory, not something happening at that very moment.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        If you’re arranging your life in such a way that you need to make a lot of fuss between feeling the itch and getting to work, you’re putting the cart before the horse. You’re probably creating a lot of counterproductive “Me, The Artist, I must create, I must leave something to posterity” melodrama. Not interesting for you or for anyone else.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Conversely, neither should you fret too much about “writer’s block”, “artist’s block” or whatever. If you’re looking at a blank piece of paper and nothing comes to you, then go do something else. Writer’s block is just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with the rather weird idea that you SHOULD feel the need to say something.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Why? If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. I the meantime, you’re better off going out into the big, wide world, having some adventures and refilling your well. Trying to create when you don’t feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation. It’s not really connecting, it’s just droning on like an old, drunken barfly.
