                 Imagine that the figures were the other way round. Imagine that women earned quarter of a million pounds more than men during the course of their lifetimes. What would the feminazis at the EOC be saying then? It doesn't take much imagination, does it?

                 "Women are having to do all the work. Women pay more taxes than men. The tax laws are discriminatory because they take more from women." And do you know what would happen next? There would be a major government initiative to stop benefits for men, and demand that they take up any work that was on offer. The government would set different tax rates for men and women in order to make sure that men could not benefit from 'sex-discriminatory' tax laws.

                 But the EOC figures show that UK men put hell of a lot more into the pot, and they take hell of a lot less out of it. And it is still the case that while men die seven years earlier than women, they are still expected to work for five more years before receiving their pensions.

                 This is going to change in the future, thanks to Brussels and the European Commission. But do notice that, working for five years longer and receiving seven years less of pension, adds up to a massive twelve years of financial injustice. A truly blatant, ongoing act of sex discrimination. An enormous act of discrimination. And what has the EOC done about this? Nothing. Nothing at all.

                 People really must take on board the fact that the EOC is a feminist organisation dominated by all the selfish, self-centred slogans of feminism. It is probably the most sex-discriminatory body in the land, despite its cosy name, and it should have been abolished a long time ago.
