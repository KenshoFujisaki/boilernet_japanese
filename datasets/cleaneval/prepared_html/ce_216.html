        AID as you all know started in the US.  Shrinaath gave you a goodoverview.  For those of you who are AID-India volunteers or from theother groups and various NGOs, we want to give you an idea of who we areand how you can tap into the talents and resources available from us inthe US.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Fist Sudhakar will talk about how we review proposals and work withprojects.  I will talk about volunteers in the US and what kind ofwork we can accomplish.  Deeptha and Ravi will talk about a chapter’sactivities.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Sudhakar: I just want to quickly go over the different aspects of projectsthat we support.  We try to do projects where the most needy peoplewill benefit.  Our approach is holistic.  The projects concentrateon health, education, environment, women’s empowerment, human rights, vocationaltraining, people’s movements, and rural development.  Though we takethese up separately, we also are guided by the AID Plan.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        We try to learn from things currently going on and also to initiateefforts ourselves.  These merged well in one significant project wehave in IIT Kanpur.  AID volunteers were directly involved with thestarting of a school in Lodhar village.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        We also work through already existing organisations, which we try toget to know when volunteers visit the groups.  Logical extension ofall this for AID to be present in India, is for AID volunteers returningto live in India, working for AID either part time (evenings/weekends)or full time.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Financial support to projects in India:
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Over the past 7 years we have worked with about 40 organizations in16 states across India.  We are still trying to reach some of thepoorest states.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        In 1998 we supported 30 projects, involving expenditure of $65,000and substantial non-financial support also.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        How we get projects – mostly through word of mouth.  When volunteersvisit villages in India they come to know of a good organisation thereand meet the people, keep in touch with them.  Or volunteers mighthear of a group in the news, etc.  Also social workers working withmany NGOs help us get in touch with organisations.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Review Process: all the review is done by volunteers.  We regularlymeet every week in something called Community Service Hour (CSH). In Maryland we meet every Saturday morning for 2 hours.  Similarlyother chapters may meet once a week or every other week.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        When we get a proposal, 2-3 people read it, visualise the project,think about the effectiveness, and how much people’s participation is there. They present it to the group, which generates questions to find out whatis the best way we can support this project.  We don’t only evaluatemonetarily.  It is not just to find out if they are honest but alsoto establish a relationship and find out how our talents and resourcescan be used to be a part of this project.  We try to visit every projectduring the review and also during the implementation.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        The CSH is a very broad meeting, many volunteer activities are partof this meeting.  In Maryland, we also have a projects committee. Projects Committee meeting concentrates only on projects.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Of course it is a very difficult task to discern success of projects,we are still learning what is the best way of assessing these things. We try to have both short (1day) and long (at least 1 week) visits by ourvolunteers to the projects.  They bring back photos, newspaper clippingsand write about their visit – all of which we keep in our files for otherinterested volunteers to look at.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Another important aspect is non-monetary support.  Sometimes volunteersget directly involved.  One volunteer bought 25 videos on differentaspects of health from WHO.  We are requesting some NGOs and movementsto review these videos and we are trying to get them translated into differentlanguages, based on their review.  We also collect educational materialslike toys.  We definitely need a lot of ideas and procedures for doingthese more effectively.  Another form of non financial support ismaking cartoon books, writing articles in a simple form on scientific topics,letters to newspapers on issues people’s movements are working on.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        We have started creating web pages about social development work goingon in India (whether we are financially supporting the group or not). A lot of people don’t know what are the different works going on in India,and how they can participate.  So suppose someone is browsing theweb they may find that yes, this is a group I want to work with. There is tremendous potential for this.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Since in the US there is access for so much information, we plan toget relevant information and tune it to the projects we are supporting– translate it, illustrate it, make into flash cards or booklets, etc –whichever way it is useful for the projects.  We also have been gettinginto providing software support.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Not only web pages, we develop many tools for awareness.  Volunteerscreate posters and brochures, write articles for magazines.  We alsoshow videos and documentaries on development and other social issues. All these help to get people involved in social development issues in oneway or another.  We also plan to get more organised in terms of internships.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Our volunteers have recommended books and videos to be purchased bythe local public or university libraries, so this makes the alternativeanalysis and perspective available to more people, and presents a differentpicture of Indian society than what is generally available in the US, evenfor Indians.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        We publish a newsletter every month on AID projects and chapter activities,this also discusses development issues.  3000 people across US receiveit by mail.  We also distribute in grocery stores where Indian peoplecome so that they cannot miss our newsletter.  We also want to getmore articles in the media, TV etc.

         I would like totalk about how a typical chapter in the US starts.  In this case thechapter is Cincinnati.  In 1997 Balaji Sampath came and talked toa group of emotionally susceptible students and AID-Cincinnati was born. We have an average attendance of about 10 people in each CSH.  Wehave 1000 people on our mailing list in Cincinnati.  We have approvedtwo projects and had two successful fundraisers.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         We had a booth at the Indian Community of Cincinnati’s 50th year ofIndian Independence Day function and sold 100 T shirts.  We hosteda welcome party for the freshies (new students) in Cincinnati.  Ourmajor successful function was a concert by Ustad Zakir Hussein, Fazal Qureshi,Sivamani and Ustad Sultan Khan.  We also had an Indian film-musicnight by a local amateur group called Alaap.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         What did we achieve?  Through our  involvement in a varietyof activities, we were able to talk to community people, which I was notable to do before this.  We discovered the importance and advantagesof teamwork.  Our presence was felt in Cincinnati, and more peoplecame to know about AID.  Ravi will now tell you about our projects.

         Being in the US, doing some of these projects gives great satisfactionto all of us.  Well doing mistakes is the best experience, and thiswas very evident in our first project, which was a failure due to coordinationdifficulties.  So I will tell you about our second project. SEWA (Self Employed Women’s Association) wanted to provide infrastructurefor craftswomen of Gujarat.  We funded about 5% of the venture. AID’s contribution is quite small but we are learning a lot by collaboratingwith an NGO.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The next is another small project we took up in Madras (Crompet) fora group called Mukti.  We are providing low cost artificial limbsfor disabled persons.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         This Mukti project also came in Time magazine, advertising lowcost artificial limbs.

         Cincinnati has taken up the task of developing a database of the governmentschemes, and making them available for other NGOs and other chapters.

        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Jagriti is our newsletter, which AID Cincinnati uses to reach out tothe local community.  We have learned that people are always willingto help, we just have to knock on their doors.  Jagriti is the maininstrument for letting people know who we are and what we are doing inCincinnati.  Our circulation is 1000 and within a month of mailingour first issue we got $1000 in the mail.  We were just too excitedabout that!  It is equal to having a fundraising concert, and directlyconveys our message.

         My name is Kiran.  I have been a volunteer of AID for about 3.5years.  I will talk mainly about volunteers in AID-US and what kindof backgrounds they are from, what kind of work we can accomplish usingthese talents.  AID-Cincinnati is one of the chapters which startedabout a year ago, we have other chapters in other parts of the US, andthe chapter in Maryland, of which I am a part, has been around for 7 years. It was started by some of the people in this room.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The flow of talent is always from village to town, from towns peoplego to cities, and from cities, abroad.  So one of our ideas is toreverse the flow of this talent.  So how can we bring some of theresources and talents among those who are well placed to the Indian villages?
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         We have a pretty diverse set of people.  For example Ramani issitting here.  He worked in an office about 1 hour away from CollegePark, where AID was born.  In the US one priority for people is livingclose to their work so that they don’t have to commute.  But whenit was clear that AID had the potential to grow, Ramani did the reverse. He actually moved closer to College Park and commuted 1 hour to work everyday.  Others who come to the CSH on Saturday mornings are likely tostay all day and help enter names into the database, attend functions,etc.  The trend to reverse the flow germinates from such small butcommitted actions.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The representative species of the AID volunteer is the graduate student. Different volunteers with different talents can find their niche and bepartof AID activities.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         What can we in AID-US do to help in development activities in India? When I say what we can do, it is not a totally futuristic dream, but someof these we have done and are confident in developing further.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         First, inspiring people to return to India.  Many AID volunteershave returned to India.  And many others are here not physically butin spirit, reading and thinking about all the issues and activities. And when they visit India this spirit will motivate them in different directions. When AID started it was completely unthinkable that a graduate studentwould want to spend 5 days during his or her India trip in visiting villages. But now we find that all volunteers have this on their agenda.  Todayyou see that 30-40 people have come to be part of this conference.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         AID volunteers interact with the groups in India through letters,visits, and project proposals.  We can help the various groups makeconnections.  For example, when Ravi and Aravinda visited the villagesof the Narmada Valley they found that they had to carry a diesel generatorin order to power the slide projector.  We were able to find a groupthat makes an inexpensive solar powered slide projector, and brought ithere with us.  We have just begun to collect educational materialsand are still getting feedback on what is useful.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         We host activists and social workers who are visiting the US. A wide spectrum of people have found this useful.  We can help youform contacts with the Indian community in the US.  We have a directreach to 3000 people and indirectly we reach many more.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         We can produce awareness and publicity materials for you.  Wehave produced a monthly newsletter for 4 years now (it started as a quarterlyin 1993 then became monthly in 1995).  Our daily e-mail AID News notonly publicizes our activities but can also be used to collect useful information. Shripad of NBA had asked for statistics on dams in different countries. We sent this on AID news, a number of people worked on it and we passedthe results on to Shripad.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         We would like to be able to provide support by writing letters on variousissues.  Sometimes as an organisation and in many cases as individualsmany of are pursuing this direction of sending petitions for importantcauses.  Several groups might find this useful.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Ramanujam:  Enabling people like Ravi, Balaji and Aravinda tocome and work full time in India, providing organisational support anddeveloping new links through them… I think this is one of the achievementsof AID USA which I would like to highlight.  I think that in termsof fundraising you should look at this as worth a million dollar project.
