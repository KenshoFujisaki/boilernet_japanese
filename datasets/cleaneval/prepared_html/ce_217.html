      The application of lessons of the past to current and predicted military issuesalways required a proper appreciation of changed technological conditions, but not untilthe latter half of the nineteenth century did the problem of adjustment offer anydifficulties. In the twentieth century it became increasingly critical, and with theadvent of nuclear weapons the entire value of past military experience as a guide to thefuture was called basically into question.

     THIS seems to be conventional wisdom: nuclear weapons have changed everything. Yet inmany respects the nuclear age can be seen not as a break with past strategic theory but asthe culmination of the evolution of strategy--the latest (and perhaps final) stage ofmilitary thought. While many tactical principles--whether of a general nature, such as thebenefits offered by holding "interior lines," or of a specific nature, such asFrederick the Great's "oblique order of march"--may indeed by outdated,principles of grand strategy have continued to evolve.

     Military thinkers of the past were not necessarily wrong in their identification ofunderlying elements of grand strategy, but they may have been wrong in seeing thoseelements as constant and unchanging. Similar themes, ideas, and principles have seemed torecur in every conflict, but their recurrence over time was on a constantly ascendingscale. In this article, I shall discuss specific instances to support this thesis, but atthis point one other general thought needs to be considered. That is the idea that grandstrategy developed differently in what we now call the Western nations (particularly inthe United States) than it did in the Soviet Union. Although both are equally rooted inclassical strategic theory and both are valid expressions of grand strategy, thestrategies of today's East-West rivals, like races of men evolved from a single ancestor,gradually acquired distinctive features. With this in mind, let us examine the origins ofU.S. nuclear strategy, then consider options to that strategy, and, finally, assess theimpact of opposing choices on decisions for or against ballistic missile defense.

Obviously, therefore, we cannot go on blithely letting one group of specialists decide how to wage war and another decide when and to what purpose, with only the most casual and spasmodic communication between them.

      Today, in an era in which a first strike may be the entire war,domination of military aims by political goals is paramount not only in theory but inreality as well. In no nation today is the military given advance approval for first useof nuclear weapons. Historically (and even today regarding conventional weapons), militarycommanders have been authorized to fire back if fired upon. However, this authorizationdoes not apply to nuclear weapons. For almost every contingency, advance approval for evensecond (or responsive) use of nuclear devices has been withheld.

      The reason why no decisive "Napoleonic" victories wereachieved in the American Civil War while they were won in the Austro-Prussian andFranco-Prussian wars was not that weapons technology had given a decisive advantage to thedefense (for the defending Europeans had weapons of equal destructive power), but that theNorth was attempting to impose a totally new order on the South, which caused anescalation to total war. In Europe, on the other hand, Bismarck and Moltke made it plainthat their objectives were much more limited and not worth complete mutual destruction. Incontrast, Napoleon and Hitler risked all and lost all by allowing political goals toexceed military capability in the face of adversaries who were fighting for thepreservation of their very societies.

      My point here is to suggest that because nuclear war today has evolved into what wouldbe an act of total violence (a concept that for Clausewitz was merely abstract), it hascrystallized the ultimate consequences, and therefore the choices, involved in total war.Where it was possible for Athens, Carthage, Napoleonic France, or Nazi Germany tomistakenly contemplate victory or at the worst (if defeated) a maintenance of the prewarstatus quo, such error in thought is no longer possible. By evolving to its pure form, warhas identified its own consequences with absolute clarity. An attacker today does risktotal destruction if it attacks a defender that can retaliate massively.

      That is obviously true today and was equally true in the past.Certainly for Carthage and to a lesser extent for both Germany and Russia in World War II,the consequences of war rivaled the possible results of nuclear holocaust. The lesson isthat war has not changed from being a practical political instrument into an impracticalpolitical instrument in the nuclear era, but that at its

Such a theory could develop and be widely accepted only in a country that had never addressed the problem of the balance of power as a historical phenomenon.

        In the middle of the fourteenth century, the Battle of Cr�cy between forces underEdward III of England and Philip VI of France demonstrated the ability of the Englishlongbow to penetrate armor and overcome the theretofore unassailable dominance of mountedknights. For the first time in nearly a thousand years, defensive infantry gained theupper hand against mounted troops.

        Previously heavy cavalry, employedexclusively on the attack, had dominated warfare; and armies unfortunate enough to findthemselves on the defensive had been forced to retreat inside fortresses and suffer thestarvation and privation of siege. Thus, technological change opened a new era of militaryhistory; and since Cr�cy (with its verdict solidly reaffirmed 70 years later atAgincourt), "infantry has remained the primary element of ground combat forces."

        Defeat for Russia in World War I was inextricably intertwined with internal politicalcollapse and revolution, but the civil war that followed found foreign expeditionaryforces once more swallowed up by the vastness of the territory and the numericalsuperiority of a peasant army. In the Second World War, traditional Russian strategy wasclassically employed yet again as Hitler met a fate nearly identical to that of CharlesXII and Napoleon. By accepting losses in both land and manpower that would have beendisastrous for smaller nations, the Soviets absorbed the Nazi offensive thrust andhusbanded its strength until a killing counterblow could be delivered. Clausewitz may nothave approved of the crudity and inefficiency of the campaign, but he would have acceptedthe conclusion as inevitable.

        A second historical lesson applicable to today's choices between strategies and theirassociated specialized weapons systems is the realization that military means must berelated to political ends. This fundamental Clausewitzian precept has often been forgottenat great cost in the past. In World War I, for example, "Foch gives littleindications in his writings of having thought about the matter at all.... Yet if the totalwar of the future is fated to be one where victory is pursued blindly, and therefore atwholly incommensurate costs which destroy its meaning, it will be more akin to the firstthan the second of the two world wars."

        In the first place, active defenses could help protect U.S. strategic offensiveweapons, hopefully destroying a portion of any Soviet attack capability launched againstcounterforce targets and preserving U.S. retaliatory might. Results following a Sovietfirst strike might therefore not reflect such a gross asymmetry in favor of the U.S.S.R.as is currently contemplated. To Bernard Brodie, this point constitutes a basic principleabout defense in general:

         Second, active defense offers a realistic possibility--perhaps the only realisticpossibility--of reducing or eliminating the frightening specter of nuclear holocaust thathas haunted most of the world for over three decades. One approach might be for both sidesto develop massive and highly effective defenses on a scale of both quantity and qualitythat could meet and destroy any combination of nuclear attack launched against them. Byusing various weapons and tactics, such defenses would reduce the effectiveness ofoffensive systems so drastically that a climate and a motive conducive to disarmamentcould result. Such a development, however, envisions a highly optimistic evolution ofdefensive versus offensive weaponry, which is historically and logically questionable. Itwould be better to assume that if both offensive and defensive weaponry continue to bedeveloped, each will contain elements of strength and weakness with neither achievingtotal dominance. In such an event, defenses would contribute to deterrence only to theextent that greater uncertainty was introduced to offensive planning. Nuclear attack wouldbe forestalled by eliminating certainty of destruction and replacing it with lessquantifiable probabilities.

        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Another (more realistic) way of eliminating the specter of nuclear war would be fordefensive strategies to be employed along with negotiated arms reductions. Assuming thatreductions in strategic nuclear weapons will be approved eventually by both the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, it is obvious that ballistic missile defense (BMD) systemswould multiply the effect of such reductions. It is generally held that the primaryproblem with BMD is the sheer mass of incoming missiles that would have to be faced in ashort time. If the numbers were reduced, associated defensive solutions would be moreviable. Even first-generation ABMs (Sprint/Safeguard) were touted as possessing goodcapability against limited or Nth-country (China) attacks.

         Eventually, ifboth sides drew down to, say, 200 launchers, defensive weapons might begin to achievevirtually certain protection. Furthermore, any reluctance to take the final step beyondreductions to total nuclear disarmarnent, stemming from a desire to retain at leastlimited options to employ weapons of mass destruction in times of crisis, might beovercome. Where without defenses there could be great misgivings about total nucleardisarmament, if it could be shown that small offensive weapons reserves were useless inthe face of effective defenses, incentives would exist to continue the arms reductionprocess. In other words, defensive weapons would promote both a climate and a motive fordisarmament by eliminating any threat of surprise. Such prospects however, depend on thedevelopment of defensive systems on both sides before they are needed. Obviously, thesooner development can begin, the better.

         IN summary, then, one can see that the fundamentals of current grand strategies aredeeply rooted in past strategic theory and, in fact, represent the culmination ofclassical theory in its purest form. A distinct difference between U.S. and Sovietstrategic doctrine exists, with the United States preferring to stress the offensive whilethe Soviets pursue a more balanced approach. To remove Soviet temptation to strike atvulnerable U.S. weapons and to serve as a "multiplier" to any arms reductions,U.S. adoption of some elements of defensive strategy and development of associatedweaponry seem reasonable and worthwhile.

         If the United States finds itself facing a numerically superior nuclear force capableof destroying two legs of its triad (ICBMs and bombers), Soviet temptation to strike atthis area of vulnerability, as pointed out by Bernard Brodie, might provide a motive forattack.

         If, on the other hand, the United States pushed ahead as rapidly as possible withresearch and development, then unilateral deployment of BMD systems by the Soviets wouldbe obviated by U.S. ability to deploy similar systems apace. Once both nations havedefensive systems in place, those systems will begin to produce the beneficial,stabilizing effects discussed earlier. The issue is how to get safety from here to there.Clearly, however, if the United States attains the capability to deploy effective BMDweapons, then it can set the pace for mutual deployment; if it is not in a position tokeep up with the Soviets, however, the United States will be faced with the uncomfortablepossibility that the Soviets may not be willing to modify or restrain their deploymentschedule.

If the United States accepts the importance and logicof strategic defenses as the Soviets have, it might only be necessary for each nation topursue diplomatic contacts and intelligence gathering to ensure themselves that noshort-term, unilateral disadvantages developed. Regardless of the likelihood of concurrenttiming, it is clear that the United States should pursue antimissile defense as vigorouslyas possible, recognizing that it is the only type of strategic program still capable ofmatching political goals with military aims. The inertia of U.S. preference for offensivestrategy, whether disguised as theories such as mutual assured destruction orpseudoscientific investigations such as cost-benefit analysis, must be overcome.
