     This paper was intended as a learning experience for the author, in anattempt to better understand the history and development of ObjectOriented Programming Languages. The research involved in this paperbegan with a variety of papers which dealt with the definition of``Object Oriented'' and from there spread out into several historic papers onthe origins of Object Oriented Programming in Simula and Smalltalk.Further reading involved mainstream reference material on many of themore widely used Object Oriented Languages, in addition to historicdocuments on their design and development.

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     What does it mean for something to be object oriented? Whatexactly is an ``Object Oriented Programming Language?'' Theseare questions that no one can answer very well. As Tim Rentsch said:
    </span>
   </p>
   <blockquote>

       ...object oriented programming will be in the 1980's what structured programming was in the 1970's. Everyone will be in favor of it. Every manufacturer will promote his products as supporting it. Every manager will pay lip service to it. Every programmer will practice it (differently). And no one will know just what it is.

   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Generally speaking, Rentsch was right not only about the 1980's, butthe 1990's as well. With all the various ``Object Oriented ProgrammingLanguages'' and ``Object Oriented Processes'' and ``Object OrientedBasket Weaving'' in the world today, it seems that establishing aclear definition of what it means to be object oriented, isimpossible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     It would appear that instead of attempting to find a coherentdefinition, a better approach is to accept the idea that programminglanguages, or processes (or widgets) can not ``Be Object Oriented.''Instead, we should consider object orientedness as a ``notion'' which canbe associated with systems, programs, languages, etc... Or similarly,as a property that something can exhibit. But just because one facetof a system has object oriented properties, does not mean that thesystem as a whole (or even other potions of the system) is objectoriented.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     When dealing specifically with programming, and programming languages,it is important to keep in mind 3 principles:
    </span>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <li>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">

    </li>
    <li>

      An Object Oriented program can be written in almost anylanguage, but a language can't be associated with object orientednessunless it

   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     But all of this side steps the issue that people ultimately want tounderstand: ``What makes programming languages objectoriented?'' To address this question, consider some excerpts (froman assortment of papers) that attempt to clarify the issue:

     In 1961 Nygaard was working for the Norwegian Computing Center (NCC),doing work with simulations and system analysis. Nygraad felt thatinstead of using existing tools, the best way to approach simulationprogramming, would be to have a special purpose simulation programming language,that could be used to model systems easily. With his background insimulations, he teamed up with Dahl (an experienced programmer withexperience in language design) in 1962.

     Nygaard and Dahl proposed their idea for a simulation language in1963, and although their ideas did not receive much enthusiasm,political issues at the NCC resulted in a contract between the NCC andUNIVAC to provide a Simula implementation and compiler by 1965 - NCCdid so, and the result is known as ``Simula-I''. Refinements were madeto Simula I and in 1967 ``Simula-67'' was released. The most recentstandard is Simula-87.

     Simula started out as an activity/process based programming language, inwhich different types (and behavior) of activities are declared, andthen multiple processes can be created to carry out differentactivities. The key power in this original design, was that inaddition to having lists of actions to be performed, processes werealso data structures, and activities has associated methods. Theseactivities and processes had so much use besides just that ofsimulation, that when Simula-67 was released, they had been renamed``classes'' and ``objects'' (thus the birth of ``object oriented''programming).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In addition to all the features of Algol 60, Simula added support forObjects (as closures which return references to themselves) withprotected state, single inheritance for sub-typing and code sharing,partially abstract classes, method overriding, and nested closures(including nested procedures, classes, and classes local to procedures).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Its interesting to note that as the father of object orientedlanguages, Simula-67 does not support dynamic dispatch - something mostpeople consider necessary for ``true'' object oriented programming.Instead, an object must be downcast (error checked at run time) andthe appropriate attribute/method can then be accessed.

     In 1961, Alan Kay was a programmer for the Air force, and noticed thatsomeone had designed a system for ``Burroughs 220'' magnetic tapes inwhich the data on the tape could be of arbitrary format and size, thebeginning of the tape contained the actual code necessary to extractthe particular type of date (This would eventually come to be known asencapsulating code and date into objects).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In 1966, Kay went to graduate school at the University of Utah, on hisfirst day he was handed a packet of orientation information - whichincluded a paper on ``Sketchpad'' by Ivan Sutherland - and found on hisdesk a pile of tapes and printouts with the note ``This is the Algolfor the 1108. It doesn't work, Please make it work.''
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Starting with the packet of information, Kay was fascinated bySutherland's paper. Sketchpad was a revolutionary graphics workstation(for it's time) which among other things: enabled the user to create``master drawings'' and from a master, create multitudes of ``instancedrawings'' with their own distinct characteristics. In addition, the datastructures used by Sketchpad were similar to the B220 tapes he hadseen in the Air Force, with embedded pointers for modifying thestructure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Kay eventually got to work on the ``Algo'' printouts on his desk, andwas thoroughly confused, there were many constructs he had neverseen before and ``the documentation read like Norwegian translatedinto English.''[Kay93] What Kay had inadvertently been given was a copy ofSimula-I. Looking over the printouts, and reading the documentation,he realized the immense potential of programming withconstructs like Simula's activities and processes, or Sketchpad'smasters and instances. Kay quickly developed a vague idea forprogramming by not only breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems, but by breaking the computer down into thousands of smallersimulated computers (or objects) to solve all of the sub problems.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Kay began working on ``personal computers'' with an eye towards an``object oriented'' interface. In 1970 left Utah to work for XeroxPARC, and began developing a desktop computer or use by childrencalled ``KiddiKomp'' (later ``miniCOM'') which had a combinationprogramming language / user interface called Smalltalk(-71) to stressit's ease of use.

     Smalltalk was redefined from scratch in 1972 on a bet, (that Kay coulddefine the ``most powerful language in the world'' in ``a page of code'')and Smalltalk-72 has since been considered the first "real Smalltalk".Smalltalk was redesigned again in 1976 by Dan Ingalls, and then againin 1980 just before it was released to the public.

     Smalltalk is an untyped, class based language. To better model thedifference between performing actions on types of objects, and on adistinct object, Smalltalk classifies attributes and methods asbelonging to either the class or to instances. Class methods arelocated in the class meta-object and can only refer to classattributes (also located in the meta-object to provide shared state forall instances). Instance methods are kept locally to each object andcan refer to both the class variables and the instance variables(which provide local state) All methods are public, while allattributes are private.

     Single inheritance is provided, along with (partially) abstractclasses, and method overriding (including signature modification).Although Smalltalk is untyped, the main purpose of inheritance is notjust code sharing. The underlying principle is similar to sub-typingin that programmers should use inheritance to provide specializationof objects, and can subsequently feel secure that it will be safe touse an instance of a subclass as if it were an instance of thesuperclass - without having to worry about run time errors.

     Self is a Classless Language, which uses prototype objects, andcloning to construct new objects. The run-time environment isresponsible for performing dynamic type checking, and there are noStatic types, or type declarations required (or even included) in thelanguage.

     The fundamental principle of Self is ``Messages-at-the-Bottom''. Alloperations are implemented as messages. Every object is composedentirely of slots, which contain either state, or behavior. When amessage is received by an object, the slots of the object are checkedfor the corresponding message. If the message is not found in one ofthe objects slots, then the pointer in the slot named ``parent'' (whichevery object has as a result of cloning) is accessed, and the messagelookup on the slots recurses up the parent pointers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Once the appropriate slot is found, the contents of the slot areeither a pointer to another object (a variable) or a method. methodscan be thought of as ``prototype activation records'' when a slot containing aprototype activation record is accessed, it is cloned (into an actualactivation record), and the a pointer to the object which was sent theoriginal message is stored in the ``parent'' slot (which can bethought of as a self pointer for the scope of the method)

     One of the most predominant features of Eiffel is built in support for``Design By Contract'', which is not necessarily object oriented, butworks well with object oriented design processes. Eiffel providesAssertions in the form of Invariants over objects, andPre/Postconditions on individual routines. In general, an Assertionis a boolean expression which has no effect if true, but otherwiseresults in a Run Time Exception. Preconditions are evaluated prior tothe body of the associated routine (in the scope of the routine'sbody, with the formal parameters bound to the actual arguments).Postconditions are evaluated after the body of the associated routine(again, in the scope of the routine's body, with the formal parametersbound to the actual arguments). Invariants are evaluated after anyfeature is accessed.

   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Assertions are extremely powerful when combined with Inheritance.Eiffel requires not only that the Invariants of all super-classes arecompatible, but that the Redefinition of any feature must eitherad-hear to the initial Pre/Postconditions of the superclass, or have a weakerPrecondition and a stronger Postcondition.

The mainaddition of 1.1 was the incorporation of Thread support from pSather(a language which had been evolving in parallel to Sather at ICSI).In addition to pSather, the language Sather-K is a derivative ofSather being developed at the University of Karlsruhe in Germany.Sather-K diverged from Sather when Sather 1.1 was released in 1995.

     3.6.4 Features and Design

   </h4>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Sather is a Class based language which borrows a lot of ideas andsemantics from Eiffel (such as Generic Classes and Exceptions) butattempts to simplify where ever possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Like Eiffel, Sather provides public and private Attributes andRoutines (in addition to read-only Attributes). But unlike Eiffel,Sather does not permit explicit access lists for Features.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Sather also provides support for the ``Design By Contract'' principle inEiffel, including Pre/Postconditions, Invariants, and generalizedAsserts, which are statements that can appear in any block of code andresult in a fatal error if they do not evaluate to true.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     The biggest difference between Sather and Eiffel is the Inheritancesystem. In Sather, Inheritance is divided into 2 notions: Sub-typing,and Code Inclusion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Sub-typing is provided purely as a method of type specialization. A(Concrete) Class my be declared as a Sub-type of an Abstract class, andall objects of the Class then automatically conform to the type of theAbstract class. An Abstract class is only an Interface containingRoutine and Attribute type signatures, and does not contain any formof implementation (and hence: can not be instantiated). EachConcrete class may be a Sub-type of at most one Abstract class, butAbstract classes can by Sub-types of any number of other AbstractClasses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In contrast to Sub-typing, Code Inclusion allows a class to directlyimport the implementation of other (multiple) classes, for the purposeof code reuse (without any affect on the Includer's type). The IncludingClass may Redefine, Undefine, Rename, or modify the access permissionsof any included Routines or Attribute, with compiler enforced Renamingof name conflicts. Similar to the notion of Abstract Classes withSub-Typing, there are Partial Classes, which posses no type (andhence: can not be instantiated) but may be included by any number ofConcrete Classes
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     (It may be convenient to think of Abstract Classes as typedeclarations which multiple Concrete Classes can implement, while PartialClasses are code repositories which can by used by multiple ConcreteClasses.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     The most impressive feature of Sather is the inclusion of the type``SAME'' which is the ``Self Type'' discussed in Object Oriented theory,but rarely implemented in actual languages.

     ``C with Classes'' was released in 1980 as an enhanced version of C(implemented using C compilers with a preprocessor) which includedClasses for data abstraction. C with Classes was designed so that apreprocessor could make direct conversions from classes to structs, bymaking member functions global, renaming them to include the classname and modifying the argument list to include a the struct equivalentof the method's class as the first argument.

In 1983 thefirst version of C++ was released and more advanced Object Orientedfeatures were rapidly until 1995 when the first commercial versionwas released. More features (including templates) were continuallyadded until 1989, at which time C++ obtained some level of stability(An ISO standard version of C++ was finalized in 1998).

     C++ is a class based language, designed to allow the programmer verylow level control over object structure and access. Object orientedfeatures of C++ include: Virtual (abstract) functions - resulting in virtualclasses, public/private/protected access control over individual memberfunctions and attributes, friend classes (for allowing explicitlynamed classes to access private state), nested classes, multipleinheritance (for sub-typing and code sharing) with methodredefinition, and templated (generic) classes and functions.

     The premise for Java arose from James Gosling in 1991, because of thefrustrations he had using C++ to program embedded systems software for``smart'' electronics devices at Sun Microsystems. Gosling began developing thelanguage ``Oak'' to be a safe, object oriented systems language. By1993 Oak had been renamed ``Java'' and several prototype electronicdevices that had been programmed with Java were available - but themarket didn't seem interest. Around this time, the WWW was drasticlyincreasing in use, and Sun began to see uses for Java's small, safe, platformindependent byte code in the online community. During 1994 thelanguage was refined and eventually released in as version 1.0 in1995. An update (1.1) was released in 1996.

    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Java is a Class based language, that was originally designed forprogramming embeded systems. Because of this, the ideas of speed, platformindependence, and run time safety are crucial in it's design. As themotivation behind the language shifted to the WWW, the issues ofspeed, platform independence, and safety remained, but the idea ofdistributed programs became extremely important. One of the mainfeatures Java provides is the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system,which allows semi-transparent method invocation and exchange ofobjects between virtual machines (even across the network)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     In addition to the RMI, other general programming features supportedare exceptions, garbage collection (which is not only supported - butconsidered crucial), byte code verification (which validates the safetyof a given program), threads, method overloading, and packages (forcreating name spaces)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     As an Object oriented language, Java supports multiple levels of implementationhiding, partially abstract classes, final classes (which can not beinherited from) and static (class) variables.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span __boilernet_label="1">
     Single inheritance of Classes is provided for subtypeing and codesharing, in addition to multiple inheritance of ``Interfaces'' - which act asType declarations, or completely abstract classes. As of version 1.1,Java now also supports nested and anonymous classes.
