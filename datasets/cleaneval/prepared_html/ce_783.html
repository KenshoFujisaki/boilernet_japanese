      , applauding President Bush's signing of the bill and referencing the signing statement. Thus it confirms the notion that the rhetorical signing statement isn't directed at mass public opinion, but rather elite opinion since elites are more important to the day to day matters of governing. There is already good evidence that in the aggregate, we know the president will issue more rhetorical signing statements when there is a federal election or when his poll numbers are in a state of flux--but that doesn't tell us much about the use of the device at the individual level. It is a promising area of study that still needs a great deal of attention.

      Next, the signing statement President Bush issued regarding the trade of nuclear material to India is taking on some interesting characteristics as well as criticisms. Further, it is also quickly becoming clear that the challenges in the signing statement may not have much to do with separation of powers concerns, or concerns over presidential prerogatives, but rather domestic and foreign politics.

      After finishing the press conference (which lasted less than an hour--only one question each for those lucky enough to get the call), President Bush walked down the hall to Room 450 in the Eisenhower Office Building, where he signed a real bastard child of a bill, the "Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006." In a
     </span>

       ten-minute statement
      </span>
     </a>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      , President Bush spelled it out--the bill was about tax reform, renewable energy, affordable health insurance, helping farmers, and busting open oversea markets. Like I said--a real bastard of a bill (there were five different versions of the bill).

     <br/>

      But while it was all smiles across the way from the White House, the protectors of prerogatives toiling away inside the White House and down the street at the DOJ office produced

       the non-public signing statement
      </span>
     </a>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      --the one that contains the real "meat and potatoes." In it, President Bush issued six (at least) signing statements with some interesting comments.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In the second paragraph, he took exception to two provisions that ordered him to submit particular recommendations to the Congress, which he noted (as he has done many times before) that the Constitution gives the power to the president to determine what he will or will not recommend. But for good measure, he also tossed in that the provision also impinged upon his authority to "supervise the unitary executive branch" (his ability to tell which executive branch officials to come up with the particular recommendations).
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In the next paragraph--and an interesting one at that--he decides to treat as advisory and not mandatory a provision that requires the "concurrence of State officials as a precondition to the execution of the laws..." Now mind you, President Bush ran as a governor, Reagan Republican, and "state's righter," yet here he is qualifying a provision that allows a state governor (and this particular provision involves western states) a say on how the federal government can lay claim to private lands (something that
     </span>
     <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=18055">
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Republicans boiled about
      </span>
     </a>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      during the Clinton administration). As such, and to make sure that everyone knew he meant it, President Bush writes that he has the authority to treat this condition as advisory because of the Constitution's "vesting in the President of the executive power and the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Wow. Calling in the big guns when you begin to rely on the vesting clause of all things.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Finally, in the last paragraph, President Bush qualifies a mandate that he consult with certain congressional committees whenever he monkeys with the Carribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, among other things. This particular provision deals with trade benefits for Haiti. Here again, similar to the previous paragraph, President Bush is overriding the concerns of certain legislators who are attempting to protect businesses in their districts or states from perceived unfair trade deals that benefit Haiti ("In General--Haiti shall be eligible for preferential treatment under this section if the President determines and certifies to Congress that Haiti...").
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      I have to credit the administration, though, regarding the publicity of the signing statements, giving the press and public ample opportunity to keep check. First, Tony Snow tells those reporters in attendance that the President is signing bills and then today, on the White House website where the
     </span>

      </span>
     </a>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      , the White House has provided a link to the private statement that makes all the challenges. So nothing underhanded here (other than alluding to a number of objectionable provisions without specifying precisely which ones are being singled out--but that is what researchers are for).

      the signings at the start of his noon press gaggle. By getting zero questions about it, or about the duplicitous statements yesterday, I think the administration got its answer.

     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Finally, to round things off, President Bush signed two other bills--again of the rhetorical variety but not mentioned at the gaggle: HR 5466: the "Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail Designation Act" and S. 3678, the "Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act" which created a new agency--the "Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority" inside Health and Human Services and "authorizes appropriations through 2011 to improve bioterrorism and other public health emergency planning and preparedness activities."

     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      What is noteworthy about today's signings? It is the first time since President Bush's first term that he issued a string of signing statements that did not challenge any provisions of the law. In fact, by looking at my data, we have to go all the way back to President Bush's first several signing statements, all of which were garden variety rhetorical statements.

     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In the parlance of those of us studying the presidential signing statement, this is what we refer to as a rhetorical signing statement, which is designed to give the administration maximum coverage, bumping off (needed in this case) any bad news for the day (temporarily, of course). But this is all smoke and mirrors--kissing babies, and first kisses, and all those good things that happen in life.

     </a>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      --the evil twin of this one--also went into effect at roughly the same period that this one was signed. This statement has been pruned of the niceties. It was not publicly announced. There were no cameras, dignitaries, reporters--nobody. This signing statement is only three paragraphs long, but don't let it's small size fool you. This one means business.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      In this particular signing statement, the President:
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Tells Congress that one section* of the bill, where Congress thinks it is setting policy, will only be treated as advisory;
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        Treats as advisory a provision** that cuts the President out of approving of any nuclear item to India that runs contrary to the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines;
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      President Bush does continue with the frustrating routine of making a challenge to several different sections for several different reasons without making it clear precisely which section he is challenging and why. Thus President Bush writes:
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>

      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">
       <span __boilernet_label="1">

       <a name="SR;570">

        , such as sections 104, 109, 261, 271, 272, 273, 274, and 275, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to protect and control information that could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </span>
     </span>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      Thus all of the attention that the signing received was directed precisely where the administration wanted, and away from the sections of the bill that the President has undermined, and by looking at Google News,

      For those of you who are counting along with me, here is the numbers to date:
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span __boilernet_label="1">
      With today's challenges, President Bush has issued a total of 137 signing statements and has made 1097 separate and distinct challenges to the provisions of the laws he has signed. It is clear that we won't have the type of signing statement we saw this time last year, but President Bush could be noteworthy by issuing one more signing statement and breaking over that 1100 mark!

This whole event, mind you, could have been avoided had Brian Lamb chosen to inform his viewers that the House was in special orders speeches, and the whole place was virtually empty. Instead, he stayed mum and launched Gingrich into the political stratosphere. Hence it is bullocks whenever Lamb or anyone else at C-SPAN tell us that they are giving it to us straight when in fact the television cameras may be used to create a false sense of reality. Whose duty is it to square the record in these cases?

      promises more oversight and challenge to the administration's use of executive privilege. The administration had informally asserted executive privilege on behalf of nearly any executive branch official who had been summoned to testify. Traditionally, executive privilege was a power that only the president could assert. Early in Clinton's first term, Clinton tried and failed to assert executive privilege on behalf of Hillary in relation to the work she did on behalf of the Health Care reform task force. However, in W's first term, the privilege was extended to the VP over records pertaining to the energy task force. Given that the Republicans never challenged the assertion of the privilege on behalf of the attorney-general, or the Secretary or State, or the national security advisor, etc. We will see whether that leads to a new challenge before the Court.

Once he said the Congress has power of the purse and confirmation powers, but didn't explain how these can work to force the president to bend. He also remarked about the subpoena power, but said little else. It could very well be that he was deliberately trying not to make news--for instance, it is clear that The Congress--either or both chambers--can cite recalcitrant executive branch officers with contempt of Congress, and clearly has in the past.
