              Which means that it's this year's SLAM.  I mean, "Is a pig's pussy pork" is only novel and, therefore, screamingly funny to people who've never listened to a Funkadelic record in their life (not the party-friendly Parliament stuff, but an out-there, acid-laced, wade-through-ten-minutes-of-aural-mud-to-find-a-nasty-ass-groove Funkadelic LP.)

              On the plus side, Taryn Manning reportedly gets hit by the nude bomb in this thing, so maybe I'll bother with it after all.  (Rationale that's worked so well for me in the past.  See:  "Campbell, Neve" in WHEN WILL I BE LOVED.)

              After washing the acrid taste of WHEN WILL I BE LOVED out of my mouth with what has come to be an annual viewing of Kenneth Lonergan's intimate masterpiece, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, I got around to thinking it'd be worthwhile to compile a list of those movies I go out of my way to watch at least once a year.  Why?  Because your mother's a crab-ridden whore.  That's why.

             <span __boilernet_label="1">
              Seriously, I don't do many repeat viewings of movies, save for certain films that captivate upon their initial release.  (In the last year, that would be ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, PRIMER, KILL BILL, VOL. 2, and THE INCREDIBLES.  And, by the way, sorry about that mother crack; at worst, she smells a bit like a wet Newfoundland.  Decrepit.  With crabs.)  But after those select flurries of viewings, those titles don't necessarily make the annual list, which, you might now be thinking smugly to yourself, is basically going to be a list of my favorite movies.  But that's where you'd be spectacularly full of shit, you see, because, while true in some respects, some of these titles are merely comfort food.  I watch LAST TANGO IN PARIS once a year, but it's not a favorite; it is, however, the film that absolutely blew my mind when I was eight years-old, and I like to revisit it to sort of gauge how phenomenally little I've matured emotionally.

              Then James Toback is your rainmaker, and WHEN WILL I BE LOVED your perverse, perfect storm.  For everyone else, it's just further evidence of a one-time worthwhile filmmaker's creative decline that began with BLACK AND WHITE in 1999.

              Toback's an odd bird:  a spoiled rich kid who insinuated himself into the black counterculture back in the late 1960's while gambling himself into serious debt *and* running up a tab of sexual conquests that would make Wilt Chamberlin break out his calculator.  He also allegedly took the biggest hit of LSD in recorded history (the annals of drug history being so scrupulously reliable).  In other words, the motherfucker lived his ass off, and, for over twenty years, these lurid exploits were often the fuel for great screenplays (e.g. THE GAMBLER,

              pure male id spurted out at 24fps about a schizophrenic concert pianist/thug (Harvey Keitel) who bears a bruising resemblance to the filmmaker himself.  It's got a Cassavetes-esque wildness about it, though it's absent the indie pioneer's humanism.  There isn't a kind bone in FINGERS' body; it's a masterpiece of misanthropy that enrages as much as it dazzles.  If you've never seen it, do so.  (Working up a head of steam writing about it, I'm wishing I had a copy at the ready myself.)

              Even when Toback is overbearing, which is always, he gets such nakedly honest performances out of his lead actors that the films, ostensibly personal statements for the writer/director, become dual confessionals.  Most people either love or hate TWO GIRLS AND A GUY; despite Natasha Gregson Wagner's most useless performance in a career littered with them, I think it's a phenomenal high wire act by Robert Downey, Jr., who rescues Toback's worst writing impulses with one of the great virtuoso film performances of the last twenty years.  Watching him as he flits about his Manhattan loft bellowing the first movement of Vivaldi's GLORIA or banging out a flamboyant rendition of "You Don't Know Me' at the piano while ineptly playing traffic cop in the two-car pileup that is his love life is to see a limitlessly talented actor redline it for ninety minutes.  It's the performance people had been waiting to see Downey, Jr. give for years, and selfishly hoping he'd get around to before killing himself.  (Thankfully, he's still with us, though it's been since WONDER BOYS that he brought his "A" game.)

              If Toback's ear was getting a bit tinny with that film, he went stone cold tone deaf with BLACK AND WHITE, which felt like Toback trying to reassert his hipster cred within the African-American community by casting every hip-hop or sports star available.  Most of the Wu-Tang Clan shows up, as does Mike Tyson, but Toback the filmmaker does not, and the film collapses into a heap of disconnected scenes that are only occasionally amusing (e.g. Robert Downey, Jr. risking his life in the name of improv by propositioning Tyson).  It's the kind of disaster that would've made for a great behind-the-scenes documentary.  Unfortunately, one has not emerged.

             <span __boilernet_label="1">
              Toback followed BLACK AND WHITE up with HARVARD MAN, which was so slipshod in its execution I didn't think him capable of a more dubious achievement.  And that brings us back to WHEN WILL I BE LOVED.  Once again, Toback trots out his famous friends -- Damon Dash, Mike Tyson and Lori Singer -- to show us that he's -- yes, Lori Singer -- still a man about town.  Meanwhile, he's investigating the balance of power in male/female relationships, and how it's predicated by material wealth.  Or something.  To tell you the truth, I lost interest early on when Frederick Weller got into an exposition-crammed screaming match with some bimbo on Times Square.  Though there was always an element of the undisciplined about Toback, he was never this clumsy in setting up his narrative.

              I knew that the cluttered Best Actor category would be the stuff of anguished disappointment today, but I was secretly convinced it would be Cheadle getting the shaft, rather than Giamatti or Neeson.  Obviously, only one of these guys was going to crack the final five, what with the other four -- Eastwood, DiCaprio, Foxx and a horrifically undeserving Depp -- being mortal locks.  So, while I'm happy to see the great Don Cheadle score his first Oscar nomination, it's an absolute injustice that the equally great Paul Giamatti will be receiving

              And it appears that the Academy fell for HOTEL RWANDA's guilt trip, while turning an indifferent shoulder to Bill Condon's KINSEY.  Being that he's a past winner, I thought Bill was a shoo-in for Best Original Screenplay.  While the competition was stiff, he really should be currently occupying the slot given to John Logan or Terry George and Keir Pearson.  So, boo.  (But "yay" for Brad Bird's nomination!)

              for the first time today.  At the Aero Theater.  In 70mm.  I've had multiple opportunities in the past to see it on crappy video bootlegs, but avoided them, preferring to see this demented, purported classic in its proper presentation.  That'll finally happen at 5 PM today.  I will report back here (at some point).

              by referencing John Carpenter's original, or Hawke's RIO BRAVO, on which Carpenter's film was based, but Renny Harlin's DIE HARD 2:  as Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), the film's protagonist, grapples with a masked bad guy, he winds up pinned to the ground next to a prison transport, its undercarriage lined with conveniently sturdy and pointy icicles.  What happens next should come as no surprise even if you haven't seen DIE HARD 2.

              Well, if you're as unabashed a fan of Harlin's idiotic, logic-flouting sequel as I am, you can read the homage as Richet signaling his crass, audience pleasing intent.  In fact, you'd really better read it as such; otherwise, you're in for a long, tedious journey through an exhaustive compendium of 1980's action film cliches that might be serving some greater thematic purpose if you

              .  Granted, the gritty seriousness of the opening prologue, in which Roenick inadvertently sacrifices his undercover colleagues during a drug buy gone bad, and its Detroit setting get things off to a rollicking, NARC-ish start, but the minute the grinding mechanics of the plot kick in, and we realize that the information imparted in that prologue could've been handled with one simple perception shift in the police station set-up, we know immediately that we're watching trash.  The question is whether it's moronic or self-aware trash.
             </span>
            </p>
            <p>
             <span __boilernet_label="1">
              This is where someone might be tempted to take me to task for suggesting that Renny Harlin has a self-aware bone in his burly Finnish body, to which I say "Samuel L. Jackson in DEEP BLUE SEA."   Obviously, there's something subversive going on in the guy's shamelessly lousy pictures, and that "something" is what Richet has deigned to ape to modestly diverting returns.  Call it the ROAD HOUSE principle:  if the filmmaker doesn't insult our intelligence by putting on airs, we'll gladly roll in the muck with him.

            <p>
             <span __boilernet_label="1">
              And, aside from that unnecessary prologue, that's mostly what Richet does, obviating the narrative inefficiency of James DeMonaco's bloated script by amping up the violence and getting decent performances out of his very good ensemble (save for an annoying-from-his-first-overly-mannered-twitch John Leguizamo).  Which is not to say that this go-for-broke sensibility results in any memorable set pieces; again, like Harlin, Richet may be able to pull of a single, well-composed shot (e.g. Gabriel Byrne's confrontation with Maria Bello), but his action choreography is pretty lackluster.  Still, despite the disposability of the major sequences, they get the job done in decent workmanlike fashion.

              for the film, and concede that he might be on to something with viewing ASSAULT as a hardcore throwback to 80's genre garbage (though I see a lot more Glickenhaus than Pyun on display here).  But this film is competent in a way those films so hilariously were not.  Richet's work is strictly Harlin-ville -- not a bad place to hang out so long as you're familiar with and accepting of the terrain.

              The only surprise is that it didn't come sooner (he's been awfully close).  Most importantly, the Cavs stay at .500 in this Western Conference road swing, though the forth quarter defensive collapse is disappointing after their great second half zone performance against the Jazz last week.  I'm not too optimistic about their chances tonight against the Kings, but I'll be watchin' nonetheless.

              I really have nothing to write about today.  I just got back from seeing IN GOOD COMPANY, and it's neither good nor bad enough to warrant much discussion.  The clunky set-up nearly drove me from the theater, but I hung around, and I'm glad I did, if only for the scattered moments that do work.  Scarlet Johansson's dorm room seduction of Topher Grace is perfectly observed right down to the lighting of the incense (ah, college).  And there's a scene near the end (actually, it

              There are those claiming that this will be a big-budget cult film, that it's THE FIFTH ELEMENT without Bruce Willis's drawing power.  While the comparisons to Besson's pretty, but empty-headed intergalactic epic will justifiably rankle Addams fans the world over, there may be something to this.  Is it possible for a cerebral sci-fi parody to find profitable purchase in a country where lazy laffers like BRUCE ALMIGHTY and MEET THE FOCKERS run riot at the box office?  Does "sardonic" sell when delivered without a serrated political edge (i.e. by someone other than Jon Stewart, Michael Moore or your typical FOX NEWS anchor)?

              On an unrelated, personal health note, I bravely made it to the forty-something minute point of CATWOMAN before tapping out.  The thought of a filmmaker aping the awful schoolyard courtship from DAREDEVIL and somehow failing to equal its inspration's basement level of incomptence made me woozy with despair.  Look, I knew the movie was going to be shit; I just thought... that... y'know... there, uh... might've been... stuff... &lt;insert .gif of Dar Robinson plummeting 220 feet from the L.A.

              Bruno Dumont returns with his cinema of climactic, left-field homosexual violation.  Unfortunately, this installment's protagonist is a cocky, fairly stupid lout of a cinematographer rather than a quiet lug of a policeman.  This makes all the difference.  L'HUMANITE was COPLAND freed of Hollywood narrative conventions, its hero spared from seeming pathetic outright by virtue of his laconic nature.  Was he stupid?  No.  Naive, yes; a mama's boy, certainly; but not stupid in the slightest.

              TWENTYNINE PALMS' David, on the other hand, is an ignoramus of Gump-ian proportions.  In one of the film's most infuriating sequences (though not *the* most infuriating), David allows his emotionally fragile French girlfriend, with whom he can barely communicate, to drive his Hummer through heavy desert brush.  Thematic implications aside, the gesture is monumentally stupid in that a) she can't drive, and b) he's obviously uptight about his cherry red Hummer, and, hell, even he'd have trouble navigating the brush that lies ahead.  I know, I know... this shows him attempting to shed his controlling personality (or piquing it out of a bizarre masochistic impulse), but whereas he'd been marginally interesting up until this point, this sequence exposes him as an asshole

              Dumont's blasting away at a number of targets here -- the exacerbated, post-Iraq American-French disconnect; male sexual primacy; American environmental rape -- but his rounds are backfiring on him.  As with L'HUMANITE, he's in complete control of his craft; unfortunately, the company he chooses to keep renders his masterful slow build excruciating this time out.

              Just so you know, no one really loves MILLION DOLLAR BABY or SIDEWAYS.  Proponents of either are respectively a) contrarians reacting to the unconscionable affection for a visually shabby salute to snobbery, or b) embracing the shlubby aesthete's ROCKY.  And the only way to remain above the fray is to heap invective on both while singing the praises of SON FRERE, MOOLAADE or MR. 3000.

              Living on the West Coast screwed me out of the opportunity to watch my Cavs absolutely dismantle the Knicks on Saturday's nationally televised game, in which LeBron didn't miss a shot until late in the third quarter (tell me you saw that reverse windmill on the highlights).  Time to rack those wins up now because a brutal Western Conference trip begins later this week, and the Cavs, being a young team with no reliable perimeter threat to keep zone defenses and double-teams on Lebron honest, are going to lose enough to allow either the Pacers or the Pistons to dislodge them from first place in the Central Division.  Now would be the time to pull the trigger on that Michael Redd trade.

              As for other Cleveland sports news... is anyone really surprised that Romeo Crennel "blew away" the Browns front office?  What'll really surprise me is if he's fool enough to take the job (though I'd love to see it happen).  And the Indians finally make an off-season free agent signing that might help them win the AL Central, but getting Millwood at this stage in his career reminds me of our blown Jack McDowell deal back in the mid-90's.  I see this guy being on the IR for most of '05, or going 11-10 while the Indians struggle to score runs.

              like taking a Dwight Evans-autographed Louisville Slugger to the neighborhood retard.  As with the NY TIMES parade of lay-ups last Sunday, this is just too fucking easy, and, in this case, betrays a strange loyalty to the fate of PHANTOM since Poland, last I checked, claimed not to really like the film.  Is he doing a solid for WB by continuing to insist that there's any awards heat on this piece of shit outside of Emmy Rossum, or merely trying to salvage his rep as an Oscar prognosticator by positioning the film as a woulda-been derailed by unfairly becoming a media punching bag ala THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST?  If it's the latter, he'd better find a more persuasive agent of influence than WENN, which probably isn't read by many Academy voters.  Also, he should probably restate the case for PHANTOM as an Oscar contender, since he's the only columnist in creation to have so seriously considered it as one.  I like David.  He's a daily read even when he's off his rocker.  But, man, he really biffed this one.
