                For most parts of the UK, there is no language capable of contending for designation as a traditional language, other than English itself.  But in Wales, the Welsh language is the traditional language, occupying a very distinctive position, historically, culturally and politically.  This status has already been recognised by the Welsh language legislation, the provision of S4C television, and the work of the Welsh Language Board.  Indeed, in some respects, this legislation has already conferred on the Welsh language greater currency than a traditional language should necessarily, as a matter of general principle, enjoy.

                 The �mother-tongue principle� could lead to unintentional but institutional racism. �Mother tongue� denotes ones language of ethnic origin. Many Sikhs may have Punjabi as their mother-tongue, yet English may be their language of choice, they may be more comfortable speaking English away from the home. Using their mother-tongue in dealings with the State, however, may be an important way for them to express their ethnic identity. A right to use Punjabi in relations with the State, if it is provided for one group, must be available for all who speak Punjabi � including Sikh converts who may be non-Aryan. Punjabi in this case becomes a communal language, not an ethnic language. A close reading of RWE�s essay will reveal that �ethnic language� is a better description what he outlines.

                  Turning to road safety, if problems exist due to linguistic problems with road signs, we need to seriously consider confiscating the cars and lorries of non-English-speaking drivers the second they reach Dover. I accept that there is a problem with the design of bilingual road signage � the confusion is usually caused by alternating monoglot English and Welsh signage, or by changing the relative position of the two languages, sometimes with Welsh on top, sometimes English. But the only way to �promote� Welsh is to make it

Most importantly, we must tackle the economic and social problems which are �linguistically cleansing� the traditional heartlands of the Welsh language. These processes exist in many parts of Britain. Language difference however makes the effect more obvious in Welsh-speaking areas.
