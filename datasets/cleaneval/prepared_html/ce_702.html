            This method of supply possesses decided advantages over all others because of its positiveness and economy of operation and the short time required to get the water on a fire. It is not necessary to telephone to a central station and start pumps, or to make connections to fire boats. And it possesses none of the various uncertainties inherent to complicated mechanical equipment.

            The capacity of a high pressure hydrant depends upon the amount of pressure at the main. The capacity when the pressure is at its highest amounts to about 3,000 gals per minute. The diameter on the various valves on a high pressure hydrant are main valves, pilot valve 3'' diameter square independent 3 1/2 reduced to 3 inches with reducers. With the exception of the one facing street which is 3 1/2 inches.

            The pilot valve is a small valve placed in the center of the main valve, it is used as a bypass. The diameter of the main valve is seven inches. The service area: 38 square inches.

          <p>

            The action of the valve is in a downward direction when opening, and the movement is against the course or pressure of water entering the standpipe. Under these circumstances it would be very difficult to make an opening on a high pressure hydrant.

            Therefore, the object of the pilot valve is to meet these conditions so that an opening can be affected in any high pressure. The pilot, which is inside the main valve, equalizes the pressure above and below the main valve and has a 3 inch diameter and a surface of 7 square inches.

            The pilot in the main valve is so arranged that the first turn of the stem operates the small valve inside only, and therefore allows the water to pass the pilot valve and the main valve into the stand pipe of the hydrant.

To inspect the independent valve, keep same closed and open main valve.
