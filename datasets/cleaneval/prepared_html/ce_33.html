       Planned, foreseen, whatever. The point is, I knew the minute that Shmi talked about the circumstances of Anakin's birth that he was "planned," and that meant to me that it was meant for him to eventually become Darth Vader. I mean, D'uh!

       Ask George Lucas this: "George, did you mean for Anakin to become Darth Vader, and that the Sith were involved in his creation? Did you intend for Palpatine, who becomes Emperor, to be the driving force (by way of what he learned from his own master) behind the creation of Anakin/Vader?

       There's no "well 'duh!" moment, Jim. You may have assumed that GL was going to head that way with the story, but you never knew, and neither did we. Technically, with what we've been told in this thread about ROTS, we can still only make an assumption.

       jabba there's a difference between guessing that plot revelation and it having been previously cemented in the text. there was all kinds of speculation as to the nature of the immaculate conception, but there was nothing in episodes 1 or 2 that indicated palpatine had to be behind it. I mean, you might as well reason since he talks so much about "planning" and "forseeing" that he was behind lando losing the falcon to han in a game of intergalactic texas hold 'em. it was a possibility, sure, but it was left open until now.

       But I digress, can anyone give me a good rating of the lightsaber duels? Is it really just a case of quantity over quality, or were you just expecting a bit too much? There are supposed to be 5 duels in this film, but they've barely warranted a mention so far. Are they really that bad?

       Yeah, call bullshit. I am sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen. I cannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this coming. I fucking saw it coming, and I have discussed this ad nauseum with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are, apparently, more intuitive than others. I can't help it that this is so.

       BTW, I think it's interesting that people here are saying my take is negative. I am definitely more positive than negative on the film, and my review at rottentomatoes will be fresh rated. But Episode III is a pretty mediocre movie, and it fizzles more than it sizzles - and frankly, Episode III needed to be the one to hit it out of the ballpark. As a generic action film it's OK, as the most important episode of the PT it's a bummer.

       And Fatboy is a douche, if only because he goes over the top about everything he ever writes about or discusses, and has no self-awareness; he's wound up leaving, dramatically, every board on the internet, and critiquing them at length on the next board he wanders to.

       The back and forth plotting between Palpatine and the Jedi Council (each is trying to use Anakin against the other) would be GREAT if it happened in more than two back to back scenes. That should have been the main plot of the movie, with Anakin increasingly torn.

       We could stretch it and hypothesize that Palpatine's masterplan was to create and then ensure the Skywalker line would continue and he would use each member like lapdogs for his nefarious schemes (because he's a lazy bastard or something), first Anakin, then his son Luke, and so on forever, but this plan (ludicrous as it sounds) is shot to shit from the beginning because of Anakin's duel with Obi 1 which leaves him more machine than man.

       I guess Palpatine was so overconfident in his powers of control that he though no apprentice would ever try to overthrow him, even with the Sith's history. Maybe he saw himself as the ultimate Sith Lord, and after Vader decided he wouldn't need any more to do his bidding, but didn't think what had gone on in the past with Sith overthrowing Sith would ever happen to him.

       I always saw Vader as a kind of advisor. Tarkin was the main military commander, and Vader was always just there in the background to represent the Emperor. A kind of Sith Advisor I guess.

       That's the problem with foreseeing things. Unlike Jim, most seers can't actually see how everything is going to work out. Palpatine could control Vader easily -- that's the great thing about conditioning someone with hate and loss.

       Vader was supposed to kill Yoda and Kenobi. With their deaths, Padme and the kids might not have lived, or the children could have been raised as Sith. (Like Jordan, Minnesota for dark jedi.) If Vader hadn't failed to kill those two jedi, none of the OT would happen, and Palpatine and Vader would still be steering the ship.

       I strongly disliked both EPs 1 and 2 right out of the gate...but in different ways. My hatred of EP1 was very confusing because I had been such a die-hard STAR WARS fan for so many years. It took me a while to fully reconcile my disappointment. I had no such hesitation with EP2.

       EP3 is a different animal. The more I think about it, the more questions I end up asking. Unfortunately, I'm not finding satisfying answers. But still, I consider it a significant improvement over EPs 1 and 2, and for that, I remain somewhat grateful that at least one of the Prequels wasn't a total failure.

       Then, Anakin converted to the Sith, and things were going to be that the Jedi would be extinguished, Palpatine would be killed by Anakin/Vader, and Padme would sit as his side as the new Imperial family in the galaxy. Kinda neat to imagine how their kids would have been like had they been raised as Sith.

       I saw early drafts of TPM script in which Anakin's father was a krayt dragon hunter on Tatooine. It would have worked just fine if Anakin's father was some long-dead hero, which would satisfy both needs: Anakin having the burden of high expectations because of his lineage, and the want of a father-figure, which Obi and Palpatine jockey to replace.

       It's important to be totally honest here...I watched this (TPM) in Leicester Square(sp) and paid out a shitload of cash to 'enjoy' it...the enjoyment lasted 'til I hit sunlight,,,(AOTC) was in a similar but not so expensive venue...as for where I'll see ROTS, I'll see where I take myself......

       AOTC I liked the first time, got caught up in it, cheered when Yoda got his groove on. However, by the second showing I was over it, too many crap scenes to forgive, and it seemed the characters had regressed (Obi-wan and Padme, I'm looking at YOU). I haven't watched it at all since its theatrical run (except for a crappy vcd copy I borrowed from a friend that had hilarious subtitles. "The Jedi will be finished, fella!":)

       Congratulations on being a good guesser, Jabba, but that doesn't mean ANYTHING in the first two prequels sets up the revelation about Palpatine being Anakin's old man.

       I don't think I was guessing. It was my take on things once Shmi started talking about the circumstances of Anakin's birth. I mean, it wasn't just coincidence that Qui Gon ended up on Tatooine, it wasn't just coincidence that he met Anakin there. It was part of Palpatine's plan, or that is what I thought. That was how I took it at the time. After all, doesn't Yoda say later to "not underestimate the powers of the Emperor?" I took that line from Ep. 6 and applied that logically to what happens in the PT. I was wrong about one thing I considered, that Qui Gon was secretly a Sith, so I'm not that good of a guesser.

       Actually, I have to agree with Fischer on this one. While I prefer the Palpatine-created version, having to decide between the two is like having to decide if you want a kick in the nuts or toothpicks shoved under your fingernails. I happen to be a fingernail guy, because I like my nuts.

       I saw early drafts of TPM script in which Anakin's father was a krayt dragon hunter on Tatooine. It would have worked just fine if Anakin's father was some long-dead hero, which would satisfy both needs: Anakin having the burden of high expectations because of his lineage, and the want of a father-figure, which Obi and Palpatine jockey to replace.

       Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't Anakin who is "the one" it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come from any virgin birth. It could also be considered that the midichlorians themselves defeated the emperor's plan by somehow manipulating Vader into wanting to join with his son, thus leading to the fall of the emperor. It was, after all, love that finally defeated the emperor, not the force. The love of a father for his son. I know I'd like to learn more about these midichlorians, and whether or not they have a form of sentience that could be communicated with on some level. Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars cartoons, or the live action series he's planning.

       This film has a higher number of laugh out loud moments than the other two. Sadly, they are all in the more intense and emotional scenes. Lucas seems to be emotionally tone deaf.

       or maybe lucas just didn't know exactly how it was going to play out either-- and during the course of writing it he painted himself into some corners that were resolved less than satisfactorily. it happens in single screenplays all the time, let alone a story that takes place over six. that wouldn't be the worst of the PT's faults. whether palpatine helped to conceive anakin or not, it's still contrived. I don't see why palpatine helping would make it less so, as it just adds another level to it (and takes more of the human element out of anakin's failure not to mention further complicates the "prophecy".) I think if it's only a single line in the movie then fatboy's interpretation is still a possibility, at least for those of us who may want to willfully ignore the added twist. I don't mind ambiguity- but to detail the whole midichlorian\immaculate conception\prophecy thing and still leave it ambiguous seems really dumb.

       The thing that's most surprising to me is that no one is really spending much time talking about The Duel. THIS is the moment we've been waiting for since the end of the second act of SW:ANH. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete; when I left you, I was but the learner, now I am the master.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       And now the people who've watched The Duel aren't even mentioning it as one of the high points of the film, as particularly emotional or even memorable. That's a horrible sign.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       The first horrible sign, of course, was the opening crawl for TPM. In retrospect, that told us everything we needed to know about the cynical, self-indulgent pointlessness of the entire PT. ROTS is simply the natural culmination of a collosal waste of film-making resources and the ultimate "fuck you" from Lucas, who seemed determined from the start to force feed his extremely beige vision of Star Wars to the masses. It's really pretty simple...Lucas had the pick of many excellent story ideas and every conceivable technical resource at his disposal to ensure thoughtful, well crafted movies. Those factors alone make the final product inexcusable...beautiful high-tech bilgewater, deliberately and defiantly thrust in our faces by a man who was sure we'd pay for it no matter what. He was right, twice. And he'll be right again this time.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       It would be interesting to see how this would've all played out if ROTS actually were a first rate film. The disconnect between it and the first two prequels would be too jarring I think, and that would've definitively cast the Prequel Trilogy as a failure (regardless of the box office). It makes you wonder if George had to "Lucasize" parts of the movie...including The Duel...to ensure that the tone of mediocrity remained at least somewhat uniform from film to film. But enough of my paranoia...

       The first horrible sign, of course, was the opening crawl for TPM. In retrospect, that told us everything we needed to know about the cynical, self-indulgent pointlessness of the entire PT. ROTS is simply the natural culmination of a collosal waste of film-making resources and the ultimate "fuck you" from Lucas, who seemed determined from the start to force feed his extremely beige vision of Star Wars to the masses. It's really pretty simple...Lucas had the pick of many excellent story ideas and every conceivable technical resource at his disposal to ensure thoughtful, well crafted movies. Those factors alone make the final product inexcusable...beautiful high-tech bilgewater, deliberately and defiantly thrust in our faces by a man who was sure we'd pay for it no matter what. He was right, twice. And he'll be right again this time.

       It would be interesting to see how this would've all played out if ROTS actually were a first rate film. The disconnect between it and the first two prequels would be too jarring I think, and that would've definitively cast the Prequel Trilogy as a failure (regardless of the box office). It makes you wonder if George had to "Lucasize" parts of the movie...including The Duel...to ensure that the tone of mediocrity remained at least somewhat uniform from film to film. But enough of my paranoia...

       I'm surprised that no one has mentioned yet that an earliy draft of ROTS had Palpatine telling Anakin flat out that he created him himself. Now does the fact that Lucas took it out mean he threw out the idea completely to go with the immaculate conception/Chosen One idea, or did he just not want to spell out Palpatine's hand in Anakin's creation and leave it up to the audience to make the connection?

       Yeah, call bullshit. I am sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen. I cannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this coming. I fucking saw it coming, and I have discussed this ad nauseum with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are, apparently, more intuitive than others. I can't help it that this is so.

       From what I've seen from both fansites and official materials, like Bouzereau's Annotated Screenplays, the "overall storyline" has changed so much over the years that the final version is virtually unrecognizable from the original conception.

       Answer me this: Why is it essential for fans to maintain the myth that Lucas planned everything out in advance back in 1974? Film, unlike books, is a medium based on contingency. Stuff is always going to be going in and out of a movie based on the availability of performers, the amount of money involved, and totally random events. On top of that, some ideas just become unworkable or silly or just plain bad over time. I'm sure that Lucas had a much bigger role planned for Jar Jar over the course of the prequels, but minimized his presence when it became apparent that everyone --EVERYONE!-- hated the shit out of the character, and not just rabid fanboys and movie critics.

       There's no shame in enjoying an epic saga, even if the author was just making it up as he or she went along. What matters is that the author maintains a certain level of quality and consistency over the course of the story-- i.e., "as long as it's good." Insisting on a single unifying vision, especially as it pertains to characters like Boba Fett, Maul, and Grevious --all more the products of toy licensing conferences than some grand Joseph Campbell mythopoeic crap-- suggests an inability to enjoy the movies for what they are. Or maybe you aren't enjoying them all that much to begin with? Search your feelings, you know this to be true...

       I guess if Lucas really had the whole story figured out 30 years ago, he would never have even publicly discussed 9 films, then 12 films, then 9 films again, then 6 films. And yet he did. He said in interviews that EPs 7, 8 and 9 would be about a character who survives JEDI. So much for that story. It wasn't until 1996 that Lucas first publicly stated that the whole Saga would be comprised of only six films, nearly 20 years after the first film hit screens and became a global pop culture phenomenon (contrary to apologists trying to downplay the impact of STAR WARS in order to make the lackluster Prequels look better in comparison.)

       I guess if Lucas really had the whole story figured out 30 years ago, he would never have even publicly discussed 9 films, then 12 films, then 9 films again, then 6 films. And yet he did. He said in interviews that EPs 7, 8 and 9 would be about a character who survives JEDI. So much for that story.

       I often wonder how much of that was Lucas and how much of it was Gary Kurtz. I'm not sure to what extent Kurtz was involved creatively (though his absence is felt in ROTJ), but I always got the feeling that he saw the SW saga as more of a grand tragic epic with a decades-long story arc than Lucas' fairy tale in space conception. In one interview, I recall Kurtz saying that only Leia would survive and she would end up in Episode XII as the "People's Quen" after the Emperor had been deposed. Darth Vader was always going to die in Episode VI (and possibly Luke with him), but the Empire would exist for some time after, albeit in a reduced form. The prequel trilogy would be largely disconnected from the other movies, with the first film set generations before the rest of the story, dealing with the foundation of the Jedi Order. But there's no real evidence to substantiate any of these claims, and Kurtz was probably just drawing on conversations he'd had with Lucas back in the '70s.

       Actually, I could swear that I just read an interview in which Lucas said that most of the prequel trilogy was "filler," and that Ep. III was the real "meat" of the PT. In other words, most of the events in Eps. I and II were just a means of killing time before Anakin's fateful lava slalom.

       Believe what you want. I think Lucas had the idea of doing a big outer space adventure in his head back in the '70s, but that was about as specific as it got. He narrowed down his focus by reading SF novels and Marvel Comics, and possibly Joseph Campbell as well, but probably more Castaneda. I suspect the theme of kids redeeming the father probably didn't occur to him until well in the pre-production of Empire, and I seriously doubt Leia was even going to be a blood relation until sometime between Empire and Jedi, regardless of the rumors about Fisher wanting a bigger role. In short, most of the transcendent themes were things Lucas came up with after 1977 and applied retroactively to the saga through the magic of filmmaking and the gullibility of fans who couldn't accept that he'd improvised most of the storyline.

       Gary Kurtz, the producer of the original versions of Star Wars: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, spoke at a Sci-Fi Expo convention audience in Plano, Texas yesterday. After reportedly offering up a mixed review of The Phantom Menace, Kurtz shared the original plans for all nine episodes of the Star Wars saga circa 1980, according to TheForce.net. When Lucas changed course with Return of the Jedi, Kurtz opted to leave the Star Wars saga and produce The Dark Crystal with Jim Henson. What follows is the fan site's description of what Kurtz allegedly relayed (no doubt to a room full of stunned Star Wars fans), and a very cool glimpse into what might have been:

This trilogy takes place some twenty years before the second trilogy, which includes Star Wars and Empire. About a year or two passes between each story of the trilogy and about twenty years pass between the trilogies. The entire saga spans about fifty-five years.

Originally, when I wrote Star Wars, it developed into an epic on the scale of War and Peace, so big I couldn't possibly make it into a movie. So I cut it in half, but it was still too big, so I cut each half into three parts. I then had material for six movies. After the success of Star Wars I added another trilogy, but stopped there, primarily because reality took over. After all, it takes three years to prepare and make a Star Wars picture. How many years are left? So I'm still left with three trilogies of nine films. At two hours each, that's about eighteen hours of film!

GL has had the entire story as an idea in his mind, since day one. He has said this himself many times, and he is meticulous and does nothing without much planning and foresight. I suggest you do a little research.

       If you look at early pre-production artwork of episode 1 you will see that Qui-Gon is nowhere to be seen. Obi-Wan had Qui-Gon's role all to himself. Before Episode II Lucas had no idea what a Dooku was. Why else did he have his design team coming up with different sorts of Sith apprentices for episode II before he came up with Dooku? Grievous? Nope, no idea of Grievous until he told his art department to design a droid general. Look at the make-up job on Palpatine in episode II and notice the differences in his appearance in Episode III. The reason for the change is because Lucas at first was flirting with the idea that Sidious would wind up looking like the Emperor of ROTJ because the darkside had slowly degraded his appearance. He obviously changed his mind on that and now Mace is responsible.

       If you look at all of these major storypoints of the prequels: Qui-Gon, Dooku, Sidious' appearance and hell, just read a making of book you'll realise that Lucas had the vaguest outline and the rest has been made up as he went along. I mean he said himself in a recent interview that Episode 1 had about 20 % of whatever basic storypoints he worked out years ago. That leaves 80% made up on the fly. The same percerntage for Epiosde II. Only Sith seems to encompass the majority of the back story Lucas originally planned out.

       I think you're saying that Kenobi should have been the central character of the PT. I couldn't agree more.

      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       That's exactly what I was saying. (I was more focused on why Anakin/Vader should have been a supporting character in that post, so I understand the cautiousness of your post.) If you think about it, actually, the films could be much more solid as they if they were edited to focus more on Kenobi and less on Skywalker. The whole problem with the PT is that Lucas, even during Ep. I, was too concerned with giving Anakin significant screen coverage. Most of Anakin's involvment in I and II are just subplots on steroids anyway ...

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Also, if they had gone that route, it would have made for a stronger saga. The PT could have been the story of the benevolent father failing to deliver his son from a path of evil and the OT would have been the negative of that: the benevolent son delivers the father from that path. The ramifications just cascade from there ... especially when you consider the tension it would have given the Yoda and Sidious relationship by making them the mentors of the central figures in the story: the patriarchs.

       It's nothing new from Lucas; the political subtext was there from the beginning, though it got submerged as the movies went on. The Emperor was conceived of as a Nixon figure, a crafty politico turned paranoid and inaccessible, and there was always the idea of a technologically superior military force being thwarted by primitive indigenous guerillas, like the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam. (Remember, Lucas was originally going to follow up American Graffiti with Apocalypse Now, so the Ewoks were probably his way of exploring that theme after losing control of the project to Coppola.) In one of the deleted scenes of Luke and Biggs on Tatooine, Biggs expresses concern that the Empire will draft Luke into service. Star Wars is definitely a product of the Watergate era, but it came out during the Carter administration, so everybody associates it with the goofy, hedonistic late '70s. By the '80s, Reagan and his speechwriters were using Lucas' imagery as a metaphor for the Cold War, something he probably never anticipated or desired. He never got over the use of "Star Wars" as a collective term for orbital missile defense. In Ep. I, Lucas repays Reagan in kind by naming the perennially befuddled and dim-witted Trade Federation leader Nute Gunray; the "Nute" comes from Knute Rockne All American, one of Reagan's best-known films, and as for "Gunray," just transpose the syllables. For a guy who celebrates forgiveness and reconciliation, Lucas can sure hold a grudge; after all, he named the second banana bad guy in Willow after Pauline Kael, who bashed Star Wars back in 1977, eleven years earlier.

       I would be genuinely surprised if most viewers made any sort of connections between the storyline in Ep. III and current events, mainly because it sounds as though the political aspects of Palpatine's rise to power are dowplayed in favor of balls-to-the-wall action. (Besides, as we all know, Lucas had it planned out in advance all along, so any parallels are purely coincidental.) In all likelihood, there will be one or two batshit crazy right-wing Medved types who label Lucas a traitor after making all those good movies about upholding conservative values, but most people won't care or notice. And they'd be wrong about Lucas' politics, too; despite being insanely wealthy, he still seems to regard himself as a radical experimental filmmaker and unreconstructed liberal who managed to beat the Man at his own game, acquiring his independence one marketing license at a time. (Insert sarcastic comment about billionaire entertainer lecturing about the dangers of attachment and materialism here.) But even if he wanted to make Ep. III overtly political, I doubt he'd be canny or subtle enough to pull it off, even in a dorky Star Trek kinda way.

       For a guy who celebrates forgiveness and reconciliation, Lucas can sure hold a grudge; after all, he named the second banana bad guy in Willow after Pauline Kael, who bashed Star Wars back in 1977, eleven years earlier.

       Come on, that was obviously just joking around with naming bad guys after the critics. There's also the two-headed monster known as the Ebersisk, and while I'm pretty sure they didn't like Howard the Duck, they were very kind to most of his films.

       If you look at early pre-production artwork of episode 1 you will see that Qui-Gon is nowhere to be seen. Obi-Wan had Qui-Gon's role all to himself. Before Episode II Lucas had no idea what a Dooku was. Why else did he have his design team coming up with different sorts of Sith apprentices for episode II before he came up with Dooku? Grievous? Nope, no idea of Grievous until he told his art department to design a droid general. Look at the make-up job on Palpatine in episode II and notice the differences in his appearance in Episode III. The reason for the change is because Lucas at first was flirting with the idea that Sidious would wind up looking like the Emperor of ROTJ because the darkside had slowly degraded his appearance. He obviously changed his mind on that and now Mace is responsible.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       If you look at all of these major storypoints of the prequels: Qui-Gon, Dooku, Sidious' appearance and hell, just read a making of book you'll realise that Lucas had the vaguest outline and the rest has been made up as he went along. I mean he said himself in a recent interview that Episode 1 had about 20 % of whatever basic storypoints he worked out years ago. That leaves 80% made up on the fly. The same percerntage for Epiosde II. Only Sith seems to encompass the majority of the back story Lucas originally planned out.

       It's a very powerful piece of film-making and the first time we get real characters and real emotion in the prequel trilogy. The ending is near-perfect. Vader being entombed in the suit, Yoda's humility after failing the Jedi and the Republic, the delivery of the twins. Amazing stuff.

       I guess the close-up on Yoda's face as the hatch shuts closed is what really makes it an homage to E.T., if that's what it really is. The good-byes and ship take-off also work as homage but are also necessary to getting Yoda off Kashyyk.

       Yeah, it's not so good, but it's not a disaster. This one is particularly frustrating for me, though, because it has entire moments and scenes that DO play, that work emotionally, thematically, or whatever, but are constantly being undermined by glaring problems: poorly written/delivered lines, moments of weird, choppy, meaningless editing (Ben Burtt fucks this movie backasswards just like Clones), small scenelets that are over before they start (the 2nd act is plagued by this), and just mismanaged stuff that could have been great, or at least passable.

       It's just so painfully obvious that Lucas' reach exceeds his grasp. There's some great non-verbal bits set to music: I loved the clones turning on the jedi across the galaxy, beautiful score, and a real sense of loss, but it's pretty contextless. Similarly, he goes for this Coppola-esque Birth of the Twins/Birth of Vader intercutting that's really magnificent all by itself (Padme's screams during labor cutting to the absolutely wrecked Anakin screaming as his limbs are re-attached) but it belongs in a different, better movie. He breaks his own SW rules all over the place in this scene (there's actually a POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a frightening isolation chamber being in the suit is).

       McDiarmid is nasty, campy fun, just as he was in ROTJ, and everyone else pretty much acquits themselves admirably. McGregor has fantastic moments, but also many, many others, where he clearly just can't take this bullshit seriously anymore (see his lines to Dooku before they fight). Portman and Christensen are much improved, especially Christensen, who I think does an admirable job with an almost unplayabe character. Who knows why anyone in this movie does anything, other than puppetmaster Lucas.

       I thought that much of the duel was really good, actually, contrary to the Chud crew consensus. I actually thought that bar a few lines, the last fourth of the film was a hint of the A-game that Lucas could have brought to the whole deal, back in the day, had he cared to. He clearly took his time with certain sequences (the purge/assault on the temple, the massacre/baptism, oops I mean "Birthing" sequence), and he pretty much went ahead and neglected the connective tissue that makes such sequences make sense, just like in the last film.

       Again, before I'm torn to shreds, this is just quick thoughts jotted down after seeing it last week. I actually feel a little nicer to it in the light of day. I'll make up my mind on the 19th.

       My biggest regret about these films will always be that he directed them all himself. He could have stepped aside after TPM and let someone else handle AOTC and ROTS. Considering some of the names that were said to be interested, I don't think we would have seen most of the things that bugged me in those films.

       I can't imagine Spielberg doing that crappy space diner scene or the floating fruit scene. I think He would have found some way to make the Anakin-Padme dialogue work. I can't imagine David Fincher having so much droid comedy in ROTS, nor the terrible Windu death/Anakin turns scene. I also can't imagine him having Anakin hop on a droid's head and ride over to continue the duel with Obi-Wan.

       I thought I might have heard the Tarzan yell buried beneath a shot when a Wookiee jumps on a Seperatist vehicle but it was so covered over with other sound effects and music, I couldn't be sure. (To be honest, most of the Kashyyk stuff didn't really engage me, so I don't remember a lot of the little details.) And yeah, just because the Tarzan yell was in JEDI doesn't mean that it was ever a good idea.

       I don't think they're trying to force their opinions on anyone so much as they're just pointing out that not everyone considers EP3 a "masterpiece" and that most of the positive reviews (so far) don't either. I think the overwhelming majority of people who see EP3 will consider it a notable improvement over the last two Prequels (I sure as hell do) but that doesn't mean it still doesn't have its own troubling flaws that are just as worth discussing as its positive attributes. Checks and balances. That's all.

       RT is way more useful as a review depositary than it is as any kind of thumbnail consensus. Their Fresh/Rotten is too vague and arbitrary to be of much use, from what I've seen. That having been said, there *is* a general "B+" vibe to the current reviews if you actually go in and read them. It's not 200 reviews, but if you consider it a 10-15% sample than it's a halfway-decent bellwether. Everyone seems to agree with what's good and what's bad about the movie, it's just a matter of degrees.

       IMHO I think RottenTomatoes is reallly interesting tool. I don't take the Fresh / Rotten rating as an absolute, nothing like RT &gt; 80% therefore i will see this film.

       As for the 22 reviews, sure there will be 200 reviews for a movie like star wars. But from looking at those 22 it's often good enough to get a trend that will indicate what the other 80-90% of reviews will be like. And that's why I posted it.

      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my inner 11-year-old shudders as I type this): it's better than "Star Wars."
      </span>
      <br/>

       But every picture, however ravishing, needs a story, and the best way to appreciate how well this one succeeds is to consider the obstacles it must surmount in winning over its audience. First of all, though there are a few surprises tucked into the narrative (which I won't give away), everybody knows the big revelation of the end, since it was also the big revelation at the end of the previous trilogy: Darth Vader is Luke's father. We also know, for the most part, which of the major figures are going to survive the various perils they face. So an element of suspense is missing from the outset.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       More than that, the trajectory of the narrative cuts sharply against the optimistic grain of blockbuster Hollywood, in that we are witnessing a flawed hero devolving into a cruel and terrifying villain. It is a measure of the film's accomplishment that this process is genuinely upsetting, even if we are reminded that a measure of redemption lies over the horizon in "Return of the Jedi." And while Mr. Christensen's acting falls short of portraying the full psychological texture of this transformation, Mr. Lucas nonetheless grounds it in a cogent and (for the first time) comprehensible political context.

       "This is how liberty dies - to thunderous applause," Padmé observes as senators, their fears and dreams of glory deftly manipulated by Palpatine, vote to give him sweeping new powers. "Revenge of the Sith" is about how a republic dismantles its own democratic principles, about how politics becomes militarized, about how a Manichaean ideology undermines the rational exercise of power. Mr. Lucas is clearly jabbing his light saber in the direction of some real-world political leaders. At one point, Darth Vader, already deep in the thrall of the dark side and echoing the words of George W. Bush, hisses at Obi-Wan, "If you're not with me, you're my enemy." Obi-Wan's response is likely to surface as a bumper sticker during the next election campaign: "Only a Sith thinks in absolutes." You may applaud this editorializing, or you may find it overwrought, but give Mr. Lucas his due. For decades he has been blamed (unjustly) for helping to lead American movies away from their early-70's engagement with political matters, and he deserves credit for trying to bring them back.

       But of course the rise of the Empire and the perdition of Anakin Skywalker are not the end of the story, and the inverted chronology turns out to be the most profound thing about the "Star Wars" epic. Taken together, and watched in the order they were made, the films reveal the cyclical nature of history, which seems to repeat itself even as it moves forward. Democracies swell into empires, empires are toppled by revolutions, fathers abandon their sons and sons find their fathers. Movies end. Life goes on.That's a solid three stars at the very least. Interesting that Scott thinks the middle-is-the-end chronology of the two trilogies works... that it not only works, but resonates with the whole 'Force' theme of Star Wars.

       I'm a little encouraged by that review. It's a better explanation for liking the film than 'Darth Vader's in it!' and 'Wow, it looks just like the original Star Wars at the end!' On the other hand, I wonder if Scott is just a little giddy over the idea that Lucas is putting George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth. Good fun for liberals like myself, but not necessarily right for Star Wars.

       This is what I'm trying to get at. While most of the folks here probably won't mind, and even enjoy such thinly-veiled criticism of the current administration, I think to a decent portion of the population it may come across as extreme partisanship. While many of you have illustrated Lucas' political subtexts in other SW films, I think it's a lot more in-your-face in ROTS, which is very un-Star Wars.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       So forgetting the fact that the film may endorse your own personal view of the current administration (by your own, I mean anyone here), it is wise for Lucas to risk dis-associating half of his audience who simply wanted to see the end of a space opera and not an idictment on the guy they voted for and maybe still have faith in? Seriously, not looking for a political lecture here, because no one's going to change anyone's mind, just looking for some honest looks at what this means for Star Wars.

       Granted, it could be argued that Lucas had this story set in '99, before Bush, but I think the sudden thrust of politics to the center of the Star Wars stage warrants some discussion.

       The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker with politics involved. The trilogy could have just focused on him and Obi 1. The Emperor and his political manoeuvres could has just been vaguely hinted at in the background of the universe. I think the focus on politics was in part, written to raise SW slightly above that often derided concept of 'mass popular culture' to be taken slightly more seriously by adults and prehaps be perceived as something even integral, or meaningful to culture, rather than something to simply escape to for a few hours, but obviously Lucas has failed at this, the story has suffered as a result.

       SW shouldnt be taken seriously, its an escapist adventure tale without logic, but full of spunk. Well, the first trilogy was anyway. The second trilogy appears to me as a schizophrenic mish mash of mediocre sci-fi, and the frantic attempts of an ageing man trying to update/modify/remix his legacy.

       That's just silly. You can't depict the creation of a dictator-led military empire without focusing on politics. Anakin's turn occurs within this context, not outside of it. Besides, Palpatine's machinations were scripted and depicted BEFORE Bush's war on Iraq. Besides, the Jedi are the UN, and they certainly don't come off as heroic, smart, or helpful in the least in this film, so there's criticism of the Right and the Left to be found in spades. If people can only see the obvious Bush metaphors, then they're not even really looking at the film.

       I disagree. The trilogy isn't just about Anakin, but also the Empire, and especially since Palpatine plays such an important role in Anakin's development and eventual turn, all of Palpatine's maneouverings are entirely necessary. For example, showing him getting into the chancellor's position, his growing influence over the Jedi, and subsequent acts against them. It's also the most interesting stuff in all of the prequels.

      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       To be fair, ever since the 70s and the whole journal of the whills deal, the rise of the Empire has always been described as this big corruption of politics. I think saying it's trying to be taken seriously by including politics is overly-cynical.

       Actually, I would liked to have seen more of Palpatine's politics and less of Jar Jar's...well, anything. All of that precious screen time, wasted. (And that's not another tired criticism of what a terrible character Jar Jar is...more like a criticism of Lucas' storytelling priorities.) When Palpatine and Anakin discuss the Sith during the opera, I actually leaned forward in my theater seat. More of the phantom menace's origins would have been appreciated by this viewer.

       Meeeh, I'll concede that it works with emphasis on politics, just didnt work for me with this specific vision. Besides, the OT hardly has any politics, and those films are meant to depict the end of an empire and the re-establishment of the status quo, or some type of equilibrium, and all we get is a few throwaway lines about some senate or something.

       I still think the PT could have worked without any direct emphasis on politics, it just would have been in the background, like online political debates/campaign adverts, or news of conflicts or coup de tat's, that characters would watch ocassionally to keep up to date with the situation, or the presence of stormtroopers slowly multiplying in more and more worlds, etc, it just could have been done subtlely, rather than the way we've seen it.

       Yes, relegating Ian McDarmid - the shining jewel of this installment according to almost every review, even the negative ones - to a less prominent role would certainly help the current Star Wars films work better. Slice his screentime in half and let's have some more witty battle droid banter.

       I consider myself an apologist with a conscience. I like the prequels for what they are, but I know in my gut they could've been so much more. I really wish Lucas would've kept his producing hat on, directed the effects and animation sequences (where his true passions lie), and left the screenwriting and directing the actors to someone(s) who could interject a little humanity.

       Most of the ideas, themes, even design and set pieces in the PT are intellectually sound. The problem is that no one feels anything. And if they do, generally its out of a sense of nostalgia rather than immediate tugging at the heartstrings.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Lucas is a master visualist. He also has a pretty good sense of story structure and has some really innovative ideas. The problem is the guy is admittedly impatient when it comes to the writing and directing processes.

       The politics of the PT are an interesting inclusion to the SW storyline, but they are far too talky and overcomplicated for their own good. Much like this post. Ahem, there is no immediate drama involved in the politics until ROTS. That to me, is a huge mistake.

       The PT as well as Matrix: Reloaded and Matrix: Revolutions are examples of first draft scripts, directors with too much power and no one to check them, and misplaced priorities. Best intentions, even when they are completely revealed via commentaries, interviews, etc., cannot make up for lackluster execution.

       Of course in my re-imagining of the PT, the Jedi would not have been the wankers we have seen them to be.

       Anyway my opinion still stands, the story of Anakin's fall did not need focus on politics, or even the Emperor, as Devin says, this I'm sure is a minority opinion, but I think still a valid one, any one of us could come up with three screenplays that could be on par with the OT without resorting to real world political allegories. Well not any one of us, but you get the jist. If we were basing the PT off of what we'd seen in the OT, all we'd essentially need, is the Clone Wars, and thats it.

      <span __boilernet_label="1">
       Defending the focus on politics, simply because of McDarmid's performance, surely means that everything else was bollocks. I'd rather downsize his role, in exchange for a better trilogy of films as a whole, with an exciting, original and involving narrative.

       I think where Lucas shoots himself in the foot with his political commentary is in Obi Wan's reply "Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes". Considering that for five films one of the basis is a very absolute idea of good vs evil (Empire/Sith Bad, Republic/Jedi Good) it's a little late to be condemning absolutes. A reply from Obi Wan like "You are truly from the Dark Side, Chacellor" would have been a hell of a lot better.

       I think where Lucas shoots himself in the foot with his political commentary is in Obi Wan's reply "Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes". Considering that for five films one of the basis is a very absolute idea of good vs evil (Empire/Sith Bad, Republic/Jedi Good) it's a little late to be condemning absolutes. A reply from Obi Wan like "You are truly from the Dark Side, Chacellor" would have been a hell of a lot better.

       Palpatine tells Anakin a story of a great Darth lord that knew the darisk side of the force so well he could blah blah blah midichlorians blah blah with merely a look. All right, so according to the story, Darth Plagus (Plagius, Plageus? whatev) conceived Anakin while Sidious was his apprentice. Sidious murders his master in his sleep and takes over the Anakin plot himself. That's what I got from it. And assuming Palpatine is lying and did the whole scheme himself seems like a pointless assumption. "Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie."? Not good enough. He plainly speaks of this great Darth lord getting axed in his sleep by his apprentice as if he was the one who did it. If we can believe that part, why can we not believe that Palpatine wasn't the telepathic sperm donor?

       Good liars mix their lies with the truth though. He could be telling Anakin the truth about his master and at the same time leading Anakin to believe that he is the one responsible for his creation. That way he hooks Anakin with the "creating life" part and then goes on and pits himself against Obi-Wan as a father figure. And plus we've alrady seen more or less the same scenario in Episdode 2 when Dooku tries to recruit Obi-Wan.

       I agree. This whole silly "Palpatine is lying" theory is incredibly thin. Besides, Obi-Wan has told far more lies than Palpatine. "Certain point of view," my ass. I'd wager that if you took all of Palpatine's dialogue from the films and do the same with Obi-Wan, Palpy would win the "Who's More Truthful?" contest hands down.

       First of all you fucking twats, there was no need for politics in the OT because The Empire had been in control for close to 20 years and I doubt that the Rebellion would have very successful by launching a political attack when the Emperor would just fry their ass with Sith Lightning. If this was Mr. Skywalker Goes To Washington, A New Hope wouldn't have been about trying to destroy a Death Star, it would have been about Luke going to the Galactic senate and making his case that the Empire is evil and that the Emperor and Darth Vader were very naughty men while wagging his finger at them as the senate hiss and boo as they slide into the shadows. Politics’ are at the very heart of how Palpatine takes over the senate and to ignore that for more space battles would be stupid and I’m quite sure that most of the people that are bitching and moaning about the politics’ here are Republican’s and they don’t particularly like looking into the mirror because they’re all fucking monkey’s with their eyes, mouth and ears closed!

       Saw this last night and overall I agree that this is best prequel yet, but that's not saying a whole lot. It's still a troubled film, with some scenes that are so embarrassingly bad that you're ashamed to be in the theater. Still, the good outweighs the bad and the prequel lovers will love it and the haters will have some of theri goodwill won back.

       That said, this movie has got serious fucking issues. The main being Hayden Christiansen and his Smarm/Assfucker/Whine approach to acting. If someone could kill him? That would be great.

       Also, I would've thought Anakin's fall to the Dark Side would've been handled with a little more......skill. What we have here is the equivalent of "I'm a Dark Lord of Sith.......NOW!" It's total bullshit.
