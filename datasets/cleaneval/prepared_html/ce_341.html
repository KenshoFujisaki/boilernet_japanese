      A LECTURE was given by the Hon'ble Sir Syed Ahmed Khan,before a large and very influential audience of Mahomedans in Lucknow,on 18th December, 1887, at 8.30 P.M., in the Baradari, Kaisarbagh, on theattitude the Mahomedan community ought to assume towards the Government,the political questions of the day, and the Bengali movement. The meedingwas attended not only by the Mahomedans of Lucknow, but by gentlemen whohad come from all parts of Upper India to be present at the Mahomedan EducationalCongress. It represented the intellect and the aristocracy, the brain andthe muscle, of the Mahomedan community. There were present the taluqdarsof Oudh, members of the Government Services, the Army, the Professionsof Law, the Press and the Priesthood; Syeds, Shaikhs, Moghals and Pathansbelonging to some of the noblest families in India; and representativesof every school of thought, from orthodox Sunni and Shiah Maulvis to theyoung men trained in Indian colleges or in England. The Syed's speech lastedan hour and a half, and was delivered with great eloquence. It was receivedwith enthusiastic applause. The chair was occupied by Munshi Imtiaz Ali,the [[2]] legal adviser of the Oudh Taluqdars' Association, a distinguishedpleader belonging to an ancient and noble Arab family of Oudh. The speechwas delivered in Urdu, taken down by Munshi Aziz-ud-din, and afterwardsrevised by Sir Syed himself. The substance of the lecture was as follows:--

     ENTLEMEN,--I am not given to speaking on politics, and I do not recollect havingever previously given a political lecture. My attention has always beendirected towards the education of my brother Mahomedans, for from educationI anticipate much benefit for my people, for Hindustan, and for the Government.But at the present time circumstances have arisen which make it necessaryfor me, I think, to tell my brother Musalmans clearly what my opinionsare. The object, gentlemen, of this lecture is to explain the attitudewhich the Mahomedan community ought to adopt with regard to the politicalmovements of the time. I am not going to give a philosophical discourse,nor to speak of those abstract questions on political economy which wouldrequire many lectures fully to deal with; but I am simply going to expressmy opinions in a plain and straightforward manner, leaving it to everyonewho hears me to agree with me or differ from me. The reason why I standhere to address you today is because there has grown up in India a politicalagitation, and it is necessary to determine what action should be takenby the Mahomedan community with regard to it. Although my own thoughtsand desires are towards my own community, [[3]] yet I shall discuss whetheror not this agitation is useful for the country and for the other nationswho live in it. If it be useful, we must follow it; but if dangerous forthe country or our nation, we must hold aloof.

     Before I enter on this subject, let me briefly describe the methods ofrule adopted by our Government, which has now been here for nearly a hundredyears. Its method is this: to keep in its own hands all questions of foreignpolicy and all matters affecting its army. I hope that we, who are subjectsof the Empire, will not seek to interfere in those matters which Governmenthas set apart as its own. If the Government fight Afghanistan or conquerBurma, it is no business of ours to criticise its policy. Our interestswill not suffer from these matters being left in the hands of Government.But we are concerned with matters affecting internal policy; and we haveto observe what method Government has adopted for dealing with them. Governmenthas made a Council for making laws affecting the lives, property, and comfortof the people. For this Council she selects from all Provinces those officialswho are best acquainted with the administration and the condition of thepeople, and also some

     ) A seat in the Council ofthe Viceroy is a position of great honour and prestige. None but a manof good breeding can the Viceroy take as his colleague, treat as his brother,and invite to entertainments at which he may have to dine with Dukes andEarls. Hence no blame can be attached to Government for making those greatRa�ses members of the Council.

     The method of procedure in the Council is this. If any member introducea subject of importance and difficulty, a commission is appointed whichcollects evidence and digests it. The matter is discussed in every newspaper,and memorials are invited from Associations.

I have had the honour of being in this Council. I do not recollectany matter of importance concerning which ten or twenty memorials werenot sent in. A Select Committee was then appointed, which read throughthese memorials and discussed them at length, many of which on considerationturned out to be thorough nonsense. Extracts from Urdu papers were alsoconsidered. Although not in my presence, yet often amendments suggestedby these memorials have been adopted. This is the method of our Government.After this the law is passed and sent to the Secretary of State, who isassisted by the Council of State, which consists of men of the highestability, who have lived for a long time in India and have often held alloffices, from that of Assistant Collector to Lieutenant-Governor. If theythink it expedient it is passed, otherwise a short note of four lines cancelsit. Often people make objections to the laws so passed, and in some casesthey are perhaps right; but in the majority of cases, as far as my experiencegoes, those very people who sit in their houses and make objections would,if they had been on the Viceroy's Council, have supported them. Many detailsappear wrong on superficial consideration, but when all the circumstancesand difficulties [[6]] are taken into account, they are seen to be right.In conclusion, whether the laws be good or bad, no one can say that Governmentacts independently of the wishes and opinions of its subjects. Often itadopts some of the views expressed in newspapers and memorials. Can wesay that Government, in the method it has adopted for legislation, actswithout regard to the opinions of the people? Can we say that we have noshare in the making of the laws? Most certainly not. (

     Butthis is the opinion of the critics who sit in their houses, who if theysat on the Viceroy's Council would change their views. The multiplicityof laws depends upon the condition of the country and of its people. Newcompanies and new industries are springing into existence. New and unforeseenlegal rights have arisen which are not provided for in the Mahomedan law.Hence, when the country is changing at such a rate, it is absolutely necessarythat new laws should be brought forward to deal with the new circumstances.Government does not want to increase the number of laws, but when the conditionsof the country change, it becomes unavoidable. Taking all these thingsinto account, I cannot but think that there is no requirement of the countrythat cannot be brought to the notice of Government. And nothing can preventour expressing our views on the subject and being heard by Government.So that whatever comfort we can experience under any Government, we haveunder the British Government. (

     and the demands which that body makes of [[8]] Government.I cannot allude to its proposals in detail because, as far as I am aware,there are forty-nine of them, and the time at my disposal is short. I musttherefore select the most important. That about which the greatest agitationhas taken place is the following. When the Government of India passed outof the hands of the East India Company into those of the Queen, a law waspassed saying that all subjects of Her Majesty, whether white or black,European or Indian, should be equally eligible for appointments. This wasconfirmed by the Queen's Proclamation. We have to see whether, in the rulesmade for admission to civil appointments, any exception has been made tothis or not; whether we have been excluded from any appointments for whichwe are fitted. Nobody can point out a case in which for any appointmenta distinction of race has been made. It is true that for the CovenantedCivil Service a special set of rules has been made; namely, that candidateshave to pass a competitive examination in England. Perhaps it will occurto everyone that this examination ought not to be held in England, andthe proposal about which the greatest agitation has taken place is thatit should be.held in India. And to this is added another proposal thatall posts in the subordinate service, from that of Tahsildar to SubordinateJudge, should also be given by competitive examination.

I do not wish to speak in the interest of my ownco-religionists, but to express faithfully whether I think the countryis prepared for competitive examination or not.

     and people of low rank, are equally allowed to pass this examination. Menof both high and low family come to India in the Civil Service. And itis the universal belief that it is not expedient for Government to bringthe men of low rank; and that the men of good social position treat Indiangentlemen with becoming politeness, maintain the prestige of the Britishrace, and impress on the hearts of the people a sense of British justice,and are useful both to Government and to the country.

     Leave this a moment, and consider what are the conditions [[10]] whichmakethe introduction into a country of competitive examinations expedient,and then see whether our own country is ready for it or not. This is nodifficult question of political economy. Everyone can understand that thefirst condition for the introduction of competitive examination into acountry is that all people in that country, from the highest to thc lowest,should belong to one nation. In such a country no particular difficultiesare likely to arise. The second case is that of a country in which thereare two nationalities which have become so united as to be practicallyone nation. England and Scotland are a case in point. In the past manywars were waged between those countries, and many acts of bravery weredone on both sides; but those times have gone, and they are now like onenation. But this is not the case with our country, which is peopled withdifferent nations. Consider the Hindus alone. The Hindus of our Province,the Bengalis of the East, and the Mahrattas of the Deccan, do not formone nation. If in your opinion the peoples of India do form one nation,then no doubt competitive examination may be introduced; but if this benot so, then competitive examination is not suited to the country. Thethird case is that of a country in which there are different nationalitieswhich are on an equal footing as regards the competition, whether theytake advantage of it or not. Now, I ask you, have Mahomedans attained tosuch a position as regards higher English education, which is necessaryfor higher appointments, as to put them [[11]] on a level with Hindus ornot? Most certainly not. Now I take Mahomedans and the Hindus of our Provincetogether, and ask whether they are able to compete with the Bengalis ornot? Most certainly not. When this is the case, how can competitive examinationbe introduced into our country? (

     Think for a moment what would be the result if all appointments were givenby competitive examination.

And first suppose that all the Mahomedan electors votefor a Mahomedan member, and all Hindu electors for a Hindu member; andnow count how many votes the Mahomedan members have and how many the Hindu.It is certain the Hindu members will have four times as many, because theirpopulation is four times as numerous. Therefore we can prove by mathematicsthat there will be four votes for the Hindu to every one vote for the Mahomedan.And now how can the Mahomedan guard his interests?

Suppose, for example, that an income of Rs. 5,000 a year be fixedon, how many Mahomedans will there be? Which party will have the largernumber of votes?

Now, I ask you to pardon me for saying something which I say witha sore heart. In the whole nation there is no person who is equal to theHindus in fitness for the work.

I am the man who attacked this wrongnotion, and while Government was hanging its officials [actually, "whilethe Government officials were hanging people"], I printed [[16]] a pamphlet["The Causes of the Indian Revolt"], and told Government that it was entirelyfalse to suppose that the people at large were rebellious. But in spiteof all these difficulties, what harm could this rebellion do to Government?Before the [reinforcing] English troops had landed she had regained herauthority from shore to shore. Hence, what benefit is expected from allthis for the country, and what revolution in the Government can we produce?The only results can be to produce a useless uproar, to raise suspicionsin Government, and to bring back again that time which we experienced thirtyor thirty-one years ago. This is on the supposition that by all of us comingtogether we could do something; but if you take the agitation as it is,what could it accomplish? The case of Ireland is held up as an example.I will not discuss the question whether that agitation is right or wrong.I will only point out that there are at this moment in Ireland thousandsof men ready to give up their lives at the point of the sword. Men of highposition who sympathise with that movement fear neither the prison northe bayonets of the police.

I only ask them to say who, not only of them but of the wholepeople of India, can tell me about the new kinds of cannon which have beeninvented

     A still more charming proposal is the following. When some people wrotearticles in newspapers, showing that it was impossible to establish representativegovernment in India, and bringing forward cogent reasons, then they camedown a little from their high flight and said, "Let us sit in the Council,let us chatter; but take votes or not, as you please"; can you tell methe meaning of this, or the use of this folly?

     Another very laughable idea is this. Stress is laid on these suggestions:that the Arms Act be repealed, that Indian Volunteers be enlisted, andthat army schools be established in India. But do you know what nationis proposing them?

     if they had made such proposals there would have been some sense in it.But what nation makes these demands? I agree with them in this, and considerthat Government has committed two very great mistakes. One is not to trustthe Hindustanis and to allow them to become volunteers. A second errorof Government of the greatest magnitude is this: that it does not giveappointments in the army to those brave people whose [[21]] ancestors didnot use the pen to write with; no, but a different kind of pen

     ) O brothers! I have foughtGovernment in the harshest language about these points. The time is, however,coming when my brothers, Pathans, Syeds, Hashimi, and Kereishi, whose bloodsmells of the blood of Abraham, will appear in glittering uniform as Colonelsand Majors in the army. But we must wait for that time. Government willmost certainly attend to it; provided you do not give rise to suspicionsof disloyalty. O brothers! Government, too, is under some difficultiesas regards this last charge I have brought against her. Until she can trustus as she can her white soldiers, she cannot do it. But we ought to giveproof that whatever we were in former days, that time has gone; and thatnow we are as well-disposed to her as the Highlanders of Scotland. Andthen we should claim this from Government.

     I will suppose for a moment that you have conquered a part of Europe, andhave become its rulers. I ask whether you would equally trust the men ofthat country. This was a mere supposition. I come now to a real example.When you conquered India, what did you yourself do? For how many centurieswas there no Hindu in the army list? But when the time of the Moghal familycame and mutual trust was established, the Hindus were given very highappointments. Think how many years old is the British rule. How long agowas the [[22]] Mutiny? And tell me how many years ago Government sufferedsuch grievous troubles, though they arose from the ignorant and not fromthe gentlemen? Also call to mind that in the Madras Presidency, Governmenthas given permission to the people to enlist as volunteers. I say, too,that this concession was premature; but it is a proof that when trust isestablished, Government will have no objection to make you also volunteers.And when we shall be qualified, we shall acquire those positions with whichour forefathers were honoured. Government has advanced one step. She hasalso shown a desire to admit us to the civil appointments in the Empire.(

     In the time of Lord Ripon I happened to be a member of the Council. LordRipon had a very good heart and kind disposition, and every qualificationfor a Governor. But unfortunately his hand was weak. His ideas were Radical.At that time the Local Board and Municipality Bills were brought forward,and the intention of them was that everybody should be appointed by election.Gentlemen, I am not a Conservative, I am a great Liberal. But to forgetthe prosperity of one's nation is not a sign of wisdom. The only personwho was opposed to the system of election was myself. If I am not braggingtoo much, I may, I think, say that it was on account of my speech thatLord Ripon changed his opinion and made one-third of the members appointedand two-thirds elected. Now just consider the result of election. In notown are Hindus and Mahomedans equal. Can the Mahomedans suppress [[23]]the Hindus and become the masters of our "Self-Government"? In Calcuttaan old, bearded Mahomedan of noble family met me and said that a terriblecalamity had befallen them. In his town there were eighteen elected members,not one of whom was a Mahomedan; all were Hindus. Now he wanted Governmentto appoint some Mahomedan; and he hoped Government would appoint himself.This is the state of things in all cities. In Aligarh also, were therenot a special rule, it would be impossible for any Mahomedan, except myfriend Maulvi Mahomed Yusuf, to be elected; and at last he too would haveto rely on being appointed by Government. Then how can we walk along aroad for which neither we nor the country is prepared?

     I am now tired and have no further strength left. I can say no more. Butin conclusion, I have one thing to say, lest my friends should say thatI have not told them what is of advantage for our nation and for the country;and by what thing we may attain prosperity. My age is above seventy. AlthoughI cannot live to see my nation attain to such a position as my heart longsfor for it, yet my friends who are present in this meeting will certainlysee the nation attain such honour, prosperity and high rank, if they attendto my advice. But my friends, do not liken me to that dyer who, only possessingmango-coloured dye, said mango-coloured dye was the only one he liked.I assure you that the only thing which can raise you to a high rank is

     . Until our nation can give [[24]] birth to a highly-educatedpeople, it will remain degraded; it will be below others, and will notattain such honour as I desire for it. These precepts I have given youfrom the bottom of my heart. I do not care if any one calls me a madmanor anything else. It was my duty to tell those things which, in my opinion,are necessary for the welfare of my nation, and to cleanse my hands beforeGod the Omnipotent, the Merciful, and the Forgiver of sins.
