          The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse estimates that 16.6 million Americans 12 or older — 7.3% of our population — are dependent upon or abuse either alcohol or illicit drugs.

          Dependency on alcohol is exhibited by the following symptoms: Craving alcohol; an inability to stop drinking once one has started; a physical dependence, as evidenced by withdrawal symptoms experienced once drinking is stopped, and a high tolerance for the substance.
