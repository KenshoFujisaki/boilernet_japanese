They lost all their deposits. the % of Tory votes for all votes cast, was the lowest since 1832 the swing from the Tories to Labour was 10% - the largest figure ever and twice that of the previous highest BUT the % of Labour votes cast was lower than in its election victories of 1945 and 1966 and its electoral defeats in 1950 and 1964. voter turnout in strong Labour areas was down in 1997 the 75 seats won by LibDems + others was the highest since 1923.

           One of the main things that came out of the 1997 election was votervolatility. If it happened in 1997, then it could happen in 2001. The number ofpeople who changed support from the 1992 election to the 1997 election has beenas high as 23% by NOP. This is an increase of 2% from the 1987 election. If thistrend is continued, as many as 25% may change their voting allegiance in 2001.

           In 1997, Labour had very strong representation amongst the 18 to 29 years oldage group. If this group feels significantly let down by the last 5 years ofLabour government, it could turn against Blair. In the 5 years from 1992 to1995, the Tories lost 18% support among this group while Labour won 19% fromthis group.

           The Tories suffered in 1997 from the electoral system. If the Tories had gotthe number of seats that their percentage of votes in each constituencyrepresented, then the overall Labour majority would have been cut to 131 - stillvery large from a Parliamentary perspective. Likewise, the LibDems success wouldhave been cut to 28 seats rather than 46. But the support for the Tories isconcentrated primarily in the south, whereas support for the Labour Party hasexpanded away from the traditional areas associated with the Labour Party. Butexpansion can always lead to contraction and tactical voting in 1997 might notrepeat itself in 2001.
