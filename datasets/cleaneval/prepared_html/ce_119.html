              When have textbooks not been biased? Look at Christopher Columbus, some countries praise him while some despise him. The state of Texas creates its own textbooks that play down the theory of evolution. There are countless other examples. It is the same with Japan and China they create textbooks to reflect their national interest and pride. I feel the reaction is completely out of control.

              The Chinese have a valid point. Japan did commit war crimes atrocities during World War II. However, the war has been over for 60 years. Japan is no longer the same militaristic country that it was in WWII anymore than Germany is. While it's wrong for Japan to whitewash its history, it's equally wrong for China to nurture old hatreds against the Japanese. The Japanese should acknowledge their WWII history and the Chinese should acknowledge Japan's peaceful progress since WWII.

             The demonstration against the Japanese textbook has not just taken place in China, but also in Malaysia, Vietnam and Korea. But because these countries have small economic relations with Japan, Japan does not care about voices from these countries. On the other hand, China speaks for the rest of Asia, or else Japanese crimes against the whole of Asia would continue to be buried and forgotten, we can forgive, but we cannot forget, millions of victims were all over the Asia, some are still alive and suffering. Even though Japan gave ODA (loan) to many Asian countries, that does not mean Japan has the power to change history or approved textbooks which show a lack of balance. Japan must reflect on its wartime history, not only for China, but also for Malaysia, Korea, and other Asian countries.

              I have personally read China's history textbooks and all its propaganda. Mao's Great Leap Forward that killed millions of their own civilians and the invasion of Tibet are all 'forgotten'. The youth in China need to read neutral history books before going out into the streets to bash Japanese restaurants and shops that are most probably owned by the Chinese.

              Of course Japan gave lots of pain to north east Asians throughout history. I'm also angry about Japan's action when it comes to talking about history distortion. But before I blame Japan, I have something to talk to the Chinese government. If they claim sovereignty of East China and adjustment about history, they should give Manchuria to Korea and stop writing wrong history about Korea. What I can see through Chinese is just hypocrisy.

             I represent a minority voice as a Japanese but I think Japan should stop portraying World War II from the victim's perspective and face responsibilities. Regardless of whether you approve of what the Chinese government says or does, the crimes committed by Japan in the past are wrong, and many Asian countries, including China, deserve an acknowledgment from the Japanese government for that.

             The Japanese apology is nothing more than sheer repetition of past Japanese PM words of hollow remorse that lacks sincerity. The visits by Japanese lawmakers to the shrine and the justifications of its own textbook revision by diverting the issue further by condemning Chinese texts as extreme were not very helpful.

              I see a lot of similarity between what China is doing now and what Japan did in the time leading to World War II; nationalistic education, large military expenditure, and aggression against neighbours. China's selective use of history reminds me of imperial Japan's use of Western colonialism in East Asia as an excuse for its aggression. China seems to think it can get away with anything as long as it keeps bringing up the history.

Chinese fanatics attack Japanese cars and restaurants disregarding the fact that the owners may be Chinese. China seems to forget the good deeds that Japan has done for China since the Meiji restoration in regards to education, scholarships, and other funding. This is not to say that Japan is innocent of its wartime aggression. Yet, China should take into account that the only country that did not break relations with China over Tiananmen was Japan.

              So, having forced Japan to make its apology again, we can now presumably look forward to China's Communist Party apologising to the Chinese people for the millions killed from violence and starvation during the 1960s and Great Leap Forward?

              While the public display of Hitler's photo and fascist symbols continue to meet serious global condemnations, why does the global community continue to keep silence when Japanese political leaders continue to pay their respect to war criminals in the Yasukuni? Is that the holocaust is more worth talking than the ripe of Nanking, and millions of civilians killed by the Japanese in East and SE Asia, not to mention the sexual assault to women. How is the Western media claimed themselves to be the fourth branch to balance the ruling power? How do we explain this discrimination in the global community?

              The Chinese government has been rather hard on Japan for some time, but especially in recent months. Many Japanese consider the Chinese government at least an accessory after the fact in the student attacks on the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai. It is plain to see that the Chinese police aren't overzealous in putting a stop to the vandalism of Japanese property.

              At the same time, it treats any reference to the more recent and continuing Chinese brutality in Tibet as contrary to the rules of international discourse. Since Tibet has been incorporated into China, what goes on there is an internal matter, and foreigners have no right to discuss it. Many Japanese have lost patience with this one-sided spirit of criticism.

              The one thing that seems to be forgotten is that less than 1% of the schools have chosen to use this controversial textbook. That would seem to suggest that most Japanese have enough common sense to reject the right wing elements that exist in most, if not all, societies. It is true that there is a problem that there are government officials who are willing to approve textbooks that are of questionable value, but I have not yet seen any government that does not occasionally get involved in boondoggles. This is probably more true in this country than in many, where the bureaucracy is absolutely mind-boggling.

             The issue is wider than Japan rewriting only China's history. While Japan since the war has been pacifist, the people are not educated on Japan's role and atrocious behaviour during World War II to all peoples in Asia and Pacific. At least the Germans understand their history.

             Koizumi's apology was politically expedient but unfortunately depressingly inadequate. He failed to make it absolutely clear what he was actually apologising for. By "aggression" was he referring to a bit of colonial bullying? The odd massacre? Systematic rape? Until these appalling facts are fully accepted within Japan, it will be hard to move on. So this apology is doomed to the same fate as weak apologies made by Japanese prime ministers in the past.

              China now needs to react with its highest level by showing the willingness from President Hu to meet Prime Minister Koizumi. The apology at an international setting illustrates Japan's commitment in building a fluid relationship with China using a common language. China ought to accept the apology, otherwise the world community will undoubtedly discount their own integrity further at a time when their domestic records are not credible either.

              Japan is a democracy. There will always be those who reject the past, as there are in Germany. This does not make them the opinion of all Japanese, or of the Japanese state. The fact is the PM of Japan apologized for Japan's actions in the Pacific War in 1995. As for Yasukuni, there is a startling correlation between Chinese government's complaints about it and the removal of communism to legitimate its power since 1978. No coincidence perhaps? China will not be satisfied unless Japan adopts its version of events, which are clearly distorted. The solution is for China to become democratic, and appreciate that allowing right-wingers to make absurd arguments about their history in public is far less dangerous than force-feeding nationalism to an entire population that has restricted access to other points of view.

              As a Nanjing native, I can never forget the 300,000 innocent people massacred here by the Japanese. I do not support Japan entering the UN Security Council, because if a nation can not face up to the crimes they committed in the past, how can people trust it?

              60 years on since WWII. The wounds may have healed in Europe. But situation in Asia remains far too distant from that. To set the record straight, I openly denounce the regrettable incidents happened during recent anti-Japan demonstration in Beijing. However Japanese government has a part to be blamed too. The outcry over Japanese school textbooks is only the latest issue to dampen Japan's relations with its neighbours. The Japanese government does not respect history and takes responsibility for history. They fail to win the hearts and minds of the people in neighbouring countries. That is the heart of the problem.

              History can repeat itself if you don't learn from it. I have Japanese friends; I think they're nice people. But I object to what the Japanese government did, they want to erase this part of memory from their people. How can their naive next-generation face their neighbours' feeling? Ignore? This will only create more hatred. No UN Security Council seat for this kind of country, period.

              The massacre of 300,000 people in Nanking in 1937 by Japanese soldiers constitutes more than an "incident" to be sure, and China has every right to call on Japan to start fessing up. But China is a bit of a glosser in its own right. How many people in China have a clear (or any) understanding of what happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989? Or how has China dealt with the invasion of Tibet in it's own textbooks?
