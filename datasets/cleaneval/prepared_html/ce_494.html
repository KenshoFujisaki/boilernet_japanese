           It has been said that a statutory scheme would be much simpler and therefore less costly than a normal judicial process. However, a large proportion of the costs of any such assessment in these cases is the difficulty of researching and reliably reconstructing events so long after they actually took place.

           In the first instance the States and churches would have to agree on their relative contributions to such a fund; and they would also have to agree, in effect, to a blank cheque, in case the initial fund proved inadequate; and, in view of that possibility, they would almost certainly require severe strictures to be imposed on the design and operation of any compensation tribunal.
