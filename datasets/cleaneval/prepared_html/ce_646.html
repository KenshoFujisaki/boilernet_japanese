             Each one of us has our own personal reasons to Relay, whether it be a family member, friend or even ourselves who has been diagnosed with Cancer. But we all Relay toward the same outcome. Hope drives us all, and we derive our inspiration from the stories and faith of others. "Because of YOU... lives are saved, lives are changed." The reason why I Relay is to preserve the memory of my Uncle Wallace Campbell, to honor my mother, Myrtle Pake, for her battle and survival of breast cancer and my father, Dennis Pake, who has had melanoma. I also Relay for you so that hopefully you will not ever hear those terrible words “You have cancer”. I Relay to raise funds for research, advocacy and patient support programs. I love fighting for a cure for cancer, bringing hope.

            The American Cancer Society is at work in communities all across the country providing programs aimed at reducing the risk of cancer, detecting cancer as early as possible, ensuring proper treatment, and empowering people facing cancer to cope and maintain the highest possible quality of life. I am extremely passionate about Relay and seeing this fight to the end. I joined the staff of the American Cancer Society in December 2004 and will happily lose the job of my dreams because of the ultimate goal: finding a cure for cancer. With God as our main supporter and each one of us, one day soon the dreaded “C” word “Cancer” will be just another word in our history books.

            I’m often asked why I am so passionate about the Relay for Life.  People wonder, is it because I’ve had cancer myself or that I’ve lost a loved one to the awful disease?  I Relay because I know it could be me someday.  We are all surrounded by cancer every day.  We can’t get away from it.  I lost a cousin this past week to lung cancer.  He was 45 years old and a single dad.  The wife of one of my co-workers was diagnosed a month ago with colon cancer.  She is 35 years old and has two small children.  These aren’t bad people.  They haven’t abused their bodies.  They’re people just like me.  I am thankful every day that I have the health and strength to do something to help find a cure.  I’m grateful that I live in a community where people care and are willing to spend some of their precious free time volunteering to raise money and raise awareness.

            On August 11, 1997, I experienced the worst day of my life (or so I thought). My 7 year old son Christopher was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I always thought this was something that happened to other people. I couldn't believe this was happening to "MY" child. I found out then, and many times since, that it can happen to anyone. As it turns out, May 10, 2001 was the worst day of my life. After a 4 year courageous battle, my "baby" lost his battle with that dreaded disease.

            With Christopher as my inspiration, I "Relay" so that some day, other children and their parents do not have to experience the horrible disease of cancer and what it does to you physically and emotionally. I don't want any child to have to go through what my son went through and I don't want any parent to have to experience the loss of a child.

           I spent my 26th birthday (October) in Asheville with my dad and his new wife.  It was then that my dad decided to tell me something that would forever change my life.  He had always complained of gall stones, so decided it was time to have them removed.  He'd had his surgery the week before.  Come to find out it wasn't gall stones he had been complaining of for the last 15 years, it was intestinal cancer.  The doctors did an open/close procedure for a biopsy to determine what all was involved.  EVERYTHING...the cancer was touching almost every part of him.  For the next 6 weeks, I would travel from Raleigh to Asheville every Friday through Sunday and spend every precious moment with my father.  We came to understand each other and express our love, support, faith and being so proud of each other.  With God beside him during the night, my father passed away December 4, 1993.  Only 6 weeks after they diagnosed him with cancer.  We had just celebrated his 56th birthday the night before, with each of his three children there.

           In the fall of 1979, a man was told he had a tumor.  A tumor, not cancer!  On January 12, 1980 this man died.  He was my Grandpa.  In late August 1990, a lady was told she had a tumor.  A tumor, not cancer!  On September 18, 1990 she died.  She was my Grannie.  On December 21, 1998, a man was told he had a mass on his throat.  A mass, not cancer!  On December 25, 1999, this man died.  This man was my dearest and best friend’s husband.  In early 2000, a man was told he had a mass in his lungs.  A mass, not cancer!  On March 10, 2001, this man died.  This man was my Uncle.

           On December 2, 1989, a baby boy was born.  A happy, healthy nine pounder.  He was such an active little boy.  He loved to work on things and figure them out.  He loved keys and loved to open things up and see what was inside. He loved his #1 baby.  A soft, stuffed little green and white rabbit.  He loved his family and his baby sister.  That baby boy turned into a little man and on August 11, 1997, which happened to be his grandmother’s birthday, he  was treated for strep throat and enlarged lymph nodes.  Strep throat, not cancer!  He was seven and a half years old.  And on May 10, 2001, this little boy died from this dreaded disease called cancer!!  This brave and courageous little boy was my great-nephew. This should not have happened.  This should not happen to any child or adult.

           I don’t know of anyone who has not been affected by cancer in some way….whether it’s battling this horrible disease personally or watching a loved one suffer.   In October 1980, after numerous tests, x-rays, and finally exploratory surgery, my mother’s doctors discovered that she had pancreatic cancer.  From the very beginning they gave us no hope and did not even recommend treatment.  My family had never had anything to “rock our world” as this did, and being in total denial we refused to accept her fate.  An oncologist finally agreed to try chemotherapy but after only two treatments, mother was too weak to go through anymore.  After suffering for six months, she passed away April 17, 1981. To this day I haven’t forgotten what she went through and the feeling of total helplessness my family felt because there wasn’t a “cure” to save our mother.  Since that time, we’ve lost a dear aunt and uncle to cancer and, although it was not the cause of his death, my dad had prostate cancer when he passed away in May 2001.  These are ALL Reasons for me to Relay, and whatever small part I play in raising money for cancer research is a labor of love in memory of these very special people.

           In the spring of 1988, one of my best friends (the pretty blonde in our attached homecoming dance picture) was diagnosed with cancer. For 3 years, she battled this disease, but ultimately lost her battle during our senior year in high school. During that time, I wasn't the friend I could have been...I didn't really know quite what to do or what to say to show her how much I cared. I wish we had Relay in my hometown back then - I know we could have done so much to fight cancer, as well as show our support for our friend. I love seeing families and friends at the Relay, often with the survivors they are supporting - your hard work means so much to them, and to all of us who want to find a cure. Thank you!

           CANCER---this six letter word brings such fear and heartache to so many.  My first response as to "Why I Relay" is to say to find a cure!  Secondly, I'm reminded of the moments in my life that have been touched by cancer (my mother-in-law surviving breast cancer, my own scare with a suspicious lump, and the death of two mothers this year in my son's 6th grade class).

           When I was asked last year to walk in the Pittsboro Relay for Life my first thought raced to the death of a dear friend's son.   I don't even live in Pittsboro and my immediate response was YES, sign me up.  The ache in my heart I feel each time I see my friend eases somewhat when I see all of the Relay teams working so hard to raise money for the American Cancer Society.  Working together we are all making a difference----no matter how big or how small the contribution.

           If you know me...you know I'm a talker.  My Grandmother, Alma Brown, was a talker too - except she got the point across in a lot less time than it takes me!  She was my best friend and soul mate.  She had seven kids, 12 grand-kids, and 11 great-grand-children!  Even though I was only one of her 12 grand-kids...she had a unique way of making me feel I was her very favorite. In fact, I even signed all my cards to her "From your favorite Grand-daughter Kay."  You know it takes someone very special to make each one of us feel so special.

           In January 2000 my Grandmother was diagnosed with renal cancer.  She died one month to the day of her diagnosis, February 14, 2000 - Valentine's Day.  She accepted what God had given her, but I had a much harder time letting go.  I made a choice to try and do something to honor her memory...I just couldn't let her slip away!  Cancer may have struck my Grandmother physically, but it actually attacked our entire family - leaving a hole where she used to be.  But the Lord is always good and works in mysterious ways and I responded to a request for volunteers for Pittsboro's first annual Relay for Life which was a HUGE success!

            Why do I Relay? I have asked myself this several times. I guess that’s why it has taken me to this, my third year involved in the Relay to put it into words. I am lucky. My family has little to no cancer. I have never lost a close relative to this horrible disease. So when I think about why I Relay I think because I was meant to. It is my responsibility to support my community, friends and family by giving back all that I can. I believe that all things happen for a reason and God has allowed me to be involved with the Relay for Life in order to show me cancer, its affects and allow these to touch my life. So when I think about why I Relay it’s to serve my friends and community, to continue the fight against this tragic disease and to touch others lives as I my self have been touched. I can only hope that my efforts compel another person to join this fight.

           In 2003, I relayed with The Survivors just to do something to help. This year, I wanted to make a bigger difference, so I decided to form a team of my own. Then in November, I was given an even bigger reason. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. But, I knew we had work to do and I had to be brave and have a deeper faith than ever before. I thank the Lord everyday because the cancer was removed and now she is going through radiation treatments. My mom is a survivor!

           My involvement in Relay For Life was initiated by a "cold call" from Carol Esau in 2003 to form a team from our church. I had not been involved in the first Relay For Life event, but had heard wonderful things about it. I took the challenge, and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful things I have done in my life. When cancer strikes someone you love there is not much you can do but pray, and be supportive. I lost my grandfather to colon cancer, my grandmother was a breast cancer survivor, my father is a melanoma survivor, two cousins died of melanoma at ages 41 and 51, and I have another cousin in her fight with breast cancer, and it does not stop there. My best friend from college days has a 7 year old daughter who was diagnosed at age 4 with liver cancer. She is in her third year after her transplant and doing great!

My hope is that through this fundraising future generations will have alternatives for treatment and a higher success rate for a cure.

           I'm not a participant from Pittsboro, I "Relay" in Cheshire, CT, but I saw your site and wanted to let you know why I Relay. I hope you don't mind me taking up some of your space. I Relay for my grandmother that I never knew because she died from cancer before I was even born, I've been told that I get my red hair and my love of reading from her, but I'll never know. I Relay for Nick, one of the first friends I can remember, he had leukemia. I remember him not having any hair and always wearing a fireman's hat, he never got to grow up, he died at the age of 11. I Relay for my aunt who is a breast cancer survivor, she is my proof that this disease can be beaten. I Relay for my uncle, who I named my team after, The Corriveau Crusaders, he survived stomach cancer, only to succumb to pancreatic cancer a year later. There have been others in my life who fought their battles with cancer, a friend's uncle, a teacher, a neighbor, some have won, others have lost. The wound that is still the freshest and the most painful is the one caused by the loss of "Pa". Pa was my surrogate grandfather, since I never had one of my own, he was my friend's grandfather and I lived next to him my entire life. He was an amazing man to everyone who knew him. He had lung cancer and had had portions of lung removed years earlier, it finally caught up to him and he died last March 2004. I Relay so I can do my part to eradicate this awful disease.
