       Islam, and generally all other religions, are not contentwith simple declarations or warnings with respect to unlawful or harmful activity andbehaviour. They are eager to prevent and eliminate the means leading to such activity andbehaviour. In this context, Muslim jurists formulated a legal principle known asSadd-u-Thara'ie, which means, in practical terms, closing the doors or removing the meanswhich lead to what is unlawful. This principle entails the prohibition of certainsubstances or activities for the simple reason that they would lead to a forbidden actionor behaviour. Some of these substances and activities might not be unlawful in themselves,but they become subject to prohibition when they can lead to some other activity that isexpressly forbidden.

       There could not be a more appropriate approach in the area ofsensual and sexual desires and gratification. Without it, the requirement to refrain fromunlawful sexual activity would be onerous, and could be even self-defeating.

       The concept of modesty refers to man's natural feeling of shame when leaningtowards committing something unlawful. This feeling acts as a deterrent against committingit. Whenever someone's instinctive desires have the best of him, one's inner sense ofshame is revived, conscience awakened and ability to reflect, refrain or repent,hightened.

       (Matthew, 5: 28). Christian teachings are full of high moral directives that provide for aclean and chaste human life. One of the most powerful of such exhortations is found in St.Paul's Letter to the Thessalonians (4:3-8) in which he says to them, "
