           We are so happily busy responding to Peace Pilgrim requests that there is often no time for our daily walk. We did walk to see the mountain lilac bush nearby.. MOUNTAIN lilac in the desert? Rare, this is the only one - now blooming with beautiful delicate lavender flowers. Every Spring we walk to see this rare flowering bush.

           We are receiving more requests all the time - letters and phone calls from around the world. We are not a big enough operation to do justice to it all. For instance, we receive many letters with stories about where and how you found Peace Pilgrim's message and how it has affected your lives. I put those letters with good quotes and stories in a special shelf and have usually been able to go through them. But I haven't had time, and here it is Newsletter time! If you are wondering why we did not put your good story in, or tell about the book you sent, maybe it will be in next time. There seems to be increasing interest in Peace Pilgrim's message.

           Several friends are concerned that we need more room for our very important work. Nancy Poer, a teacher of Waldorf School teachers would like the Peace Pilgrim Center to be next to their ranch near Placerville in the foothills of the Sierras, a very beautiful wooded area. In our next newsletter, we plan on printing more about our growing need for a larger, on-going, permanent Peace Pilgrim Center. Some of these friends formed a committee called: "Friends of Friends of Peace Pilgrim" to help us grow.

           Another friend, Kathy Miller, who has given over her home to the Documentary Crew, has loved so much being a part of a Peace Pilgrim operation that she wants to spend her retirement years helping to spread her message.

           Here are some samples of our days: A call from Holland for more STEPS for her Pilgrimage to Jerusalem. One day we packaged boxes of books for India, Alaska and Thailand. On another day we had a phone call and fax from Alaska, a family of four from Japan, and a call from a group in Alaska studying Peace's book once a week. We packaged a box of books for an Indian who wants to translate the book into Gandhi's language, Gujarati. Meera Bhatt, a devoted Gandhian worker, has translated STEPS into Gujarati and also plans on translating the book. We hope they have gotten together on this project.

           was born out of a therapy group watching a documentary video called, THE SPIRIT of PEACE. The walk was designed to last for one week with strong support. The project grew into the entire month of October...walking for peace. It is pledged that each candidate carry out a one-half hour walk, up to 2-3 days a week during morning, afternoon or evening yard periods.

           The purpose of this walk is to promote peace and it is not limited to peace following a violent act or a war, but also for the pain or distress that we go through as inmates. This also symbolizes participation in the 1999 Peace Movement. On January 1, 1999, the Peace Movement began a run that has a runner in it 24 hours a day, until December 31, 1999. It is designed to cover all countries in the world. The subject of the video, PEACE PILGRIM, walked over 25,000 miles in the name of peace, inspired the class to come together and play an essential role in the Peace Movement of 1999. (The peace walk was supported by many organizations and individuals.)

I'm afraid I cannot hope to convey to you a correct feeling that affected me on reading this booklet. For one thing it left an indelible impression upon my mind and it did give me food for contemplation and put me in a mood of reflections.

I make sure I can understand English there's no difficulty in reading it in original. I am so infinitely obliged to you in advance.

           - First of all I want to thank God for all of you. I am reading the PEACE PILGRIM book. By the time I had read up to page 45 I had to stop and write my wife and tell her about the book. I am 44 years of age and I have never read a more heart-felt book. It has given me more insight to God than the Bible and that's because I'm reading about a person who lived the Bible. He asks for a copy to be sent to his wife.

         <p>

           Several years ago I connected with Chris, another reader of this newsletter, who lives in a prison. We began a rich and rewarding correspondence, exploring many ideas associated with inner peace.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span __boilernet_label="1">
           In the summer of 1998 I learned that Chris was working 60 hours a week at his prison "job," receiving about 15 cents an hour so that he could save money to buy his daughter a birthday present that fall. His health was suffering, and he didn't have energy for activities, such as sharing what he was learning about inner peace with the other prisoners.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span __boilernet_label="1">
           After receiving his letter explaining this situation, I was given an inspiration; it seemed so right and lovely that I sent the following proposal to him: If you will cut out back your "work" hours, I will pay you double what you are earning (30 cents/hour - big deal!) to organize and lead a Peace Pilgrim study group there. Three nights a week, three hours each night, for ten weeks will earn you $27, enough for the gift you want to buy.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span __boilernet_label="1">
           To sweeten the offer a bit, I also offered to send an equal amount to the Peace Pilgrim center to help pay for any materials they sent him for the study group. I kept his accrued "salary" and ordered various mail order catalogues to be sent to him when he decided on the toy he wanted for his daughter. I ordered and paid for it with his "earnings" from our agreement, bypassing the bureaucracy of the prison system and assuring his daughter received her gift from daddy on time.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span __boilernet_label="1">
           I will never know whose hearts were touched by learning about Peace Pilgrim in this way, but it sure made me feel good! It is rare in my life to be able to give such a meaningful gift for so little expenditure. And I had the added blessing of knowing that my friend, whose health was not the greatest, was working less and opening himself more to Peace's life and words through sharing them with others.

           - Hi, I've gotten hold of the Peace booklet and it is starting to change my life. I understand what you are saying about peace and love and I like it. It's a cool concept and I am already starting to apply the information in my daily life! If you could please send me the Peace booklet and the Peace Pilgrim book, I would really appreciate it. If the Peace booklet can do this much for me, I can only imagine what the book will do, so you will be hearing more from me. Thank you for helping me to realize the truth and begin the change for peace in my life.

           - I would like to express my gratefulness for such an awesome book PEACE PILGRIM, which you kindly sent me. As I look at the word "gratefulness" it doesn't begin to tell what I really feel. It is something more deeper and stronger. The book makes me so excessively happy indeed, for that I am infinitely indebted to you.

           It seems to me that the message "Overcome evil, etc should be made known to everyone on earth, because it points the way to the future destiny of the world. However my attempts to share the message with my friends are in vain. They just let it go by. I think that our lives are becoming more busy nowadays. We run from one thing to another focusing on the ephemeral, whereas we are supposed, as I am willing to believe, to spend some time with ourselves in introspection, in development.

           Personally, by doing so it was a new start for me, and the book helped me a lot in many ways. I'm so happy to see the progression of mine. How well do I remember one evening dark and starry, when I was reading the book and my Mom showed a friendly interest in it. What once sounded strange and unbelievable now sounds reasonable and plausible. Nowadays, I translate for my Mom whenever my free time coincides with hers. I ask to be on your mailing list and to have Peace materials sent to me which might most contribute to my spiritual growth.

Each conference participant was given a packet of materials, which included a copy of PEACE PILGRIM IN HER OWN WORDS. Over two cases of books were distributed. Reiki Peace Network and Reiki University have distributed hundreds of STEPS TOWARD INNER PEACE booklets through mailings. A copy of the Peace Pilgrim book has been given to each Reiki University student who has taken a hands-on healing workshop for the past several years.

           HateBusters is a 501 c-3 non-profit organization, dedicated to opposing hate, teaching people how to like one another. HateBusters was founded in 1988 when a member of the Ku Klux Klan was elected to Louisiana Legislature. The governor invited us to come and help the state redeem itself. Clergy and Church Against Race Violence organized in 1998 when a cross was burned in Kansas City, Kansas. Local clergy led a successful community effort to secure a conviction and educate the community to the seriousness of cross burning.

           When crosses are burned, we get on the telephone &amp; internet, contact religious &amp; political leaders in the town where the cross was burned. With our help, local leaders bring together citizens of the community, and within 72 hours of the cross burning everyone comes to the victim's home. TV and newspaper reporters come, and news of the cross burning is over-ridden by news of good people doing bold and noble deeds. Redemption has begun. The one or two or three people who burned the cross have aroused hundreds, thousands who come to prayer vigils, sign statements condemning cross burning, send money to aid victims and write love letters to encourage them.

           Six crosses have been burned in Greater Kansas City since 1991. Seven men have gone to Federal Prison for burning crosses - hundreds to prayer vigils. Thousands of people publicly condemned cross burning. Thousands wrote love letters to victims. On April 11, 2000, 37 residents of Greater Kansas City were recognized as HateBuster Heroes for their leadership in organizing a massive public response to this assault on our community, an insult to our hopes of creating a loving place to live. Our 37 HateBuster Heroes included high school &amp; college students, rabbis, mayors, preachers, city managers, high school teachers and college professors; Christians, Jews, Bahai's, Hindus, Muslims; African-Americans, Anglos and Mexican-Americans. On that April night every TV news program in Kansas City carried a story about our HateBuster Heroes. All of Greater Kansas City saw and was inspired by these 37 heroes who had risen from among us to lead us from those six dark nights of burning crosses into the bright light of high noon where we all stand up and stand together against those who hate and hurt the most vulnerable among us.

A few weeks ago when I was yet again trying to make my 11 year old son see the importance of willingly doing the things I asked him to do, I said in exasperation, "Just think how would you manage if you didn't have me to guide you." (His father died a few years ago.) He replied, "I would do all those things that Peace Pilgrim says to do." That was very comforting to me.

           From the 6th to the 13th of December 1999, Peace Pilgrim's message once again went out over the airways. Paul Barber, host of the radio talk show "The Journey" at WELI radio 960 in New Haven, Connecticut, spent the entire week featuring Peace Pilgrim on his program. Paul's show focuses on uplifting themes of self-development and a positive approach to life.

          <span __boilernet_label="1">
           During the show, which aired from 11 to 11:45 AM on weekdays, Paul talked about Peace Pilgrim's life and work. He also read excerpts from STEPS TOWARD INNER PEACE and discussed Peace's outline for personal development and peace. Callers to the program had an opportunity to comment on Peace's message and share stories of their own inner journey. Copies of STEPS were available to people who called in to the station, either to talk or just to request a copy. Peace Pilgrim webmaster, Bruce Nichols, who had just returned to Connecticut from a visit in Hemet, was a guest on one installment and shared some of his experiences doing volunteer work at the Friends of Peace Pilgrim Center. While Paul no longer does the morning show, he continues to bring his message of positivity and personal growth to listeners of WELI on weekday evenings.

           - Here I write to you in hopes that all may be at peace there in Hemet. As for the moment, things are a little `shaky' here in the prison system in Texas. Luckily for me here at my unit, all is peaceful. I currently remain in constant reading over and over regarding the fine book entitled, PEACE PILGRIM. I would like to extend my gratitude for the time you took in making certain that my request for literature was sent. At this moment, I would ask/request that you please send 2 copies of PEACE PILGRIM to the following persons listed below. One is for my mother to read and the other is for the Chaplain of this unit.

           I have to admit that for the 10 years that I have spent here in prison, nothing comes as close to telling the truth as honestly and sincerely as does this book! I am now certain I can look forward to my journey from this day forward. so long as I have this book to turn to every time I may begin to stumble. For this I am grateful that people, such as you all, are continuing to spread the word and get the message out. I am also providing a time-sheet of my record for you to KEEP as a reminder that you all have reached a person who was once in serious trouble and lost in this life. I am now freer in my inner self and hope that every new day continues to bring me and everyone around me a better tomorrow. I close with my heart saying, Thank you so very much for your time.

           For the third spring semester in a row I am requesting PEACE PILGRIM for my students. Thank you for providing this text to my students in the Introduction to Peace And Conflict Studies course that I teach every spring. Every semester many of my students thank me for introducing Peace Pilgrim and providing them with this text. I can assure you that students almost never thank any teacher for their texts. Many times I'm asked how they can obtain extra copies for friends.

I also use the video of Peace Pilgrim you provided, which inevitably generates interesting discussion.

I am hungry to get more. Our war escalated in '97 and we have hardly had communication from outside. They are just starting to come into the country again.

After finishing Friends College I became engaged in Peace work within my Yearly Meeting. I am using Peace Pilgrim books in this work. I have been praying for peace. Peace Pilgrim books have helped many people in my community. I can see young people change from worse to better life. Peace Pilgrim's life is inspiring many.

           The project is part of an historic peace initiative in Costa Rica known as "Costa Rica 2000: new millennium of peace." It is one very important event in a series of important events scheduled throughout the year in Costa Rica to highlight peace. The proposed statue of Peace Pilgrim was given final approval by the University for Peace in March, and shortly thereafter well-known Costa Rican sculptor, Fernando Calvo, began work on the full-size bronze statue that will require at least six months to complete.

           As part of the events planned around the time of the statue's dedication, Jemila Ericson has agreed to come to Costa Rica in her role as Peace Pilgrim to speak to school children, peace groups, and the media - as Peace Pilgrim might have done if she were alive today. Mayte Picco-Kline, who translated the Peace Pilgrim book into Spanish, will also be in Costa Rica at that time to speak in fluent Spanish to groups and the media, about her work and Peace Pilgrim's message. The producers of the film have been asked for permission to have a premier showing of the new documentary on television in Costa Rica during the week the statue is dedicated. Channel 7 is willing to consider this if a good sound track can be made in Spanish.

           Of those coming to participate in special ways, many will be able to share their experiences and insights on a radio program broadcast throughout the world from the University's Gandhi Center for Communications. The dedication ceremony itself will be an international showcase for peace, hopefully coinciding with the meeting of the International Council which oversees the University for Peace.

Whichever date is chosen, on the preceding Saturday, November 11 or 18, an academic seminar is planned to be held at the University or elsewhere, where people who knew Peace Pilgrim or have been influenced by her work, can meet one another and share their experiences, insights, and resources for peace, out of which perhaps a core curriculum for peace can come. We hope many will want to come to Costa Rica for these inspiring and extraordinary historic events.

Perhaps you knew Peace Pilgrim personally and were influenced by the gentle example of her life. Many more, like myself, never had the privilege to meet her, yet have been profoundly influenced by her through the efforts of her friends in printing her book, and so generously sending it to any and all who request it, without charge. Like many of you, I owe a great debt of gratitude to Peace Pilgrim and Friends of Peace Pilgrim for the spiritual classic they produced and have so lovingly and lavishly bestowed amongst us. They do not ask for financial contributions, but in these special circumstances, I ask on behalf of their work, in the interests of furthering that work in the best ways that we can possibly imagine, taking it to new levels of international recognition, and providing a broader forum for Peace Pilgrim's message.

           The funds needed for this project are between $18-$25,000, depending on the statue's final placement and setting at the University. If a Spanish sound tract is made, the cost will be about $5000. We hope that many hands will make light work! This is a gem of a peace education project, which we hope you will support with joy and generosity. Some larger gifts are necessary, but the success of the project ultimately rests upon many, many small donations. Equipping the new film with a sound track in Spanish is one good place to start. Who can gauge the eventual power and impact that this film might have in the world if it is equipped with sound tracks in even a few other languages? Any funds received over and above the cost needed for the statue will go directly to the film for a good Spanish sound track first, and then into as many other languages as we have funds to consider.

           We are thankful that several friends have created a committee, "Friends of Friends of Peace Pilgrim" to help us spread her message. Mary Newswanger, a member of this committee, is a Quaker pacifist living in Monteverde, Costa Rica. She found a well-known Costa Rican sculptor who will create a statue of her walking, for a reasonable amount. Mary has spread Peace Pilgrim's message before. Twelve years ago, as Secretary of the Wider Quaker Fellowship in Philadelphia, she recommended including STEPS booklets in a mailing to 3000 people in 80 countries. One of the many results - a Peace Pilgrim Centre in Moscow and PEACE PILGRIM &amp; STEPS booklet in Russian. It will be wonderful to have a statue of Peace Pilgrim in Costa Rica, along with other outstanding peace advocates.

           Our sculptor had the beautiful idea of the statue being level with the ground, not upon a pedestal. This will create the feeling of having her among the people gathered around her, without a sense of distance. He also suggested having a level stone-like floor with the words of her mission, "This is the way of peace: Overcome evil with good, falsehood with truth and hatred with love" written In both English and Spanish.

Instead of housing these men in the usual tar-paper shacks he built five beautiful villages in wooded areas. This cost a lot more than tar-paper shacks but the quality and stability of the work force were so high that it actually saved money. Furthermore, the accident rate was reduced by 85% over what was expected in jobs of that size, saving 30 lives.

My income was not much higher than theirs, and I deliberately ran the company as a community. I hired Blacks, Japanese - Americans and Jewish refugees from Europe on an equal basis with everyone else. In the atmosphere of community the ethnic differences ceased to matter. Our sales policies were carefully designed to fit the needs of our customers. Caring and sharing was a great success.

           We will never be able to pay you in cash for your generosity. We shall certainly do it by our poor prayers. Both you and we shall fight the battle for the same cause - PEACE THAT PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING. Today, India, our beloved country, known for its spirituality, is under the influence of evil. The people are suffering - the rich become richer and the poor become poorer.
