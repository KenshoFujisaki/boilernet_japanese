        That was something my Mom used to say to me when I was little. And it�s true. There were times in my young life where I had a decidedly �can�t do� attitude. I�d come up with all sorts of reasons why I just couldn�t do something. Of course my mother, with her motherly wisdom and years of experience, knew all too well that I could do these things.

        I was either lazy, or scared or intimidated or just plain didn�t want to do. This is an attitude I see quite often from Web professionals and I can�t help buy wonder why.

        Now that I�m older I can better recognize the �can�t do� when it pops up, in myself and in others. And frankly it pisses me off more often than not. Sure there are times when you really can�t do something and there are legitimate times when you simply don�t want to do something for whatever reason. But more often than not it seems to be laziness, fear or lack of know-how.

        I�ve been guilty of this and to be honest, I�m really working on never again blaming a bit of technology on anything unless it�s really the reason why something can�t be done and I�ve got no hope of trying another technology or getting around it in some way.

        Technology shouldn�t make business decisions

      </h3>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        In many cases I�m seeing that the technology (or, more accurately, the people using the technology) is driving business decisions. This, to me anyway, is totally backwards. A classic cart before the horse situation. It reminds me of a �dot-bomb� experience I had awhile back. I worked for a company who would let their testing department dictate the release schedule. Sure this was great for the geeks who felt they always needed more time, and simply �couldn�t conform to marketing�s aggressive schedule.� But it drove the rest of the company crazy.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        I always thought this was bullshit. I mean, shouldn�t business people make business decisions? If you can�t handle the workload, hire more people. If you�re technology isn�t flexible enough to handle the requirements laid out by your designers, get a new technology. Technology should help you solve problems, not create more.

      </h3>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        99% of the time I hear someone crow about not being able to do something it sure as heck can be done. Sadly oftentimes instead of actually getting done it gets half-assed or compromised in someway and this more often than not causes failure for the project. You can usually chalk that up to poor decision-making or ego.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        And why to companies insist on riding a technology until the bitter end? I mean if it�s really a hinderance and you know it�s going to fail, wouldn�t it make sense to kill it and go a new direction sooner rather than later? I�ve seen millions (yes, millions) wasted on a poor choice of technology.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        I think this is usually an attitude problem, cultivated by having to deal with poorly developed technology. There are a few ways around this. First, take a positive, problem solving attitude and second, get better (more flexible, more standard, more appropriate, etc.) technology.

        As well, successful leaders know when to put their ego on ice and pull the plug on something that is destined for failure. A sure sign of successful leadership is how they deal with bad decisions and crisis.

         I suppose in a round about way, it comes back to being their own fault though. Decision makers have heard the call to �listen to your tech staff�. Problem is, their own ignorance causes them to do so even when they really shouldn�t.

         Rimantas � Good point. However the idea behind what I�m saying is true and in that case I�m not talking about programming. Ideally you�d have the resources before you begin. I guess it could say �work harder� as well. The bottom line is that something like a testing cycle should never, ever, dictate the release date of a product.

         I�ve seen this in a number of large IT organizations that I�ve worked with and I�m equally appalled by the �can�t do� attitude of many of the people I encountered. They can�t get it to work, they can�t meet the schedule, they can�t imagine being flexible or adapting to changing business needs. Drives me nuts.

         Jenel, my girlfriend, was complaining about this last night. Her IT department refuses to network the design department�s Macs. So any of the packaging die-lines she get from vendors need to be posted to an FTP server so the design people (10 feet away) can pull it down and work on them. With a little reading and tinkering the macs could be up and running on the network.

         Questions like that force people to throw out the �it�s not worth the effort� side of their argument, which is generally the *only* side of their argument. At that point, they are forced to think of the real work involved and not just what their opinion of the task is.

         That might actually be true. CMS are complex things. With good ones, you can do anything you want. With bad ones, you can�t. If the system has architectural flaws, there will be more than one thing (and also more than a dozen things) you cannot do. Stupid hacks to emulate the wanted behavior are not a solution, as they consume too much time and in the end won�t work as intended anyway.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         CMS are also expensive. You cannot go ahead and just switch to another one which solves your problem. Okay, you can. It�s nowhere close to impossible, it just takes a huge amount of money and manpower. The problem is: somewhere along you�ll stumble across something called cost-value-ratio. And there�s no point in implementing whatever feature for, say, a web site that would make the customer� uh huh, you�re spot on, some dumb feature the customer won�t even notice. It�s time for a workaround here, time to sit down and decide to take another approach to the problem instead of wasting money and time just because some technology, be it from earth or outer space, can do it.

         Building your project on a reusable component will 1) save you money/time and 2) restrict your project to what that component was designed to do.

         Okay, I confess. I�ve used the technology excuse not out of laziness, but out of having to explain why something *shouldn�t* be done. Quite a few people (mostly the older ones) don�t want to be bothered with long-winded (or even short-breezed) explanations of why something shouldn�t be done. Instead, I find myself on occasion saying that something just isn�t technically feasible, even when I know it is. I know that client education is an important issue, and I do want to help these people understand why some of their suggestions just aren�t a good idea. But if they don�t want to hear it, what other option is there?

         david � you�ve touched on exactly what I�m talking about. Of course there are hundreds of CMS systems out there that literally can�t do many things. I�ve argued many times in the past that most CMS solutions aren�t worth jack. Still, this is where proper planning comes in, and I�m telling you that sometimes, most times, it�s better to cut your CMS losses early rather than deal with failure. We did that at my last job (Children�s Hosptial) and in the long run saved a bunch of money and ended up with something that met its goals and that we could be proud of.

         Nice article Keith. I do think that you may have missed a crucial point however. DISCLAIMER: I am speaking from my experienc in IT at my company, I don�t want to sound as if this applies to everyone or every company, etc.

         Everyday single day, I tell internal customers that something can not be done, and I am not being lazy, trying to sidestep a stupid request, etc. It really is that it can�t be done. No, really. And, it is the fault of the business people who did not trust IT in the first place during technology review, requiremetns definition, etc. The culture here at my job is FUBAR. Problem is, the business people chose the technology to begin with, without a full understanding of the consequences of their decision. This is due to a lot of factors: not trusting IT, rushing projects, etc.

         Now Keith will come back and say �then get a new technology�. And he is right. BUT, �easier said than done�, in a culture such as mine couldn�t be more appropriate.

       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         I could go on and on about the circumstances, reasons, etc. But the fact remains, in my company, IT didn�t push back enough against the business people, we let them make the decisions to begin with - �business needs drive technology selection, not the other way around�. In my companies� case, it didn�t exactly work out. I know this is an exception, but thought I�d share.
