         Serial communications has lost a lot of importance over the last five to ten years.  Now there are much higher speed and specialtynetworks.  However, there are stillplenty of devices in factory and laboratory automation that only have a serial interface.  Hopefully this pagewill help you understand what it takes to read and write devices using RS232,RS422, and RS485.

       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The original RS232 standard was developed about 40 years ago and specifiesthat the maximum baud rate is 19,200 and the maximum cable length is 50feet.  While that may have been good 20 years ago -- it's too short andslow today!  Although today's computers are clocked to support much higherbaud rates -- technically you need to be careful.  You also need to becareful about using long cable lengths.  Many people have gotten 100 foot cables to work, the question isreliability.  If we are using good quality cable and connectors and haveerror detection built into the protocol then we might go over the 19,200 and 50foot limits.  Errors will be detected and we'll know how much of a problemit is.  Otherwise we'll stick to the limits to minimize our risk or useRS422 or RS485.

        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         RS422 and RS485 use a balanced line approach that eliminates many problemswith RS232.  For example Profibus is based on RS485 and Profibus runsat speeds up to 12 Mbaud (625 times faster than 19,200 baud).  The problems with RS422 and RS485 is that the set-up is moredifficult: you have to use more expensive cable (for proper impedance andcapacitance), properly terminate the ends ofthe cables, set addresses, etc.  But the advantages are longer cablelengths, higher baud rates, and multiple devices share the same communicationnetwork.

         are two favorites for serial communications.  These two websites also have tutorials about serial communications.  B&amp;B Electronics products usually cost less but Black Box usually has higher quality.  So for demos, training, testing purposes we typically use B&amp;B equipment.  For actual installations we typically use Black Box.  (We want to minimize risk and those calls in the middle of the night).  In all fairness to B&amp;B Electronics, if you buy their products and all the separate options (isolation, surge protection, etc) that may be built-in to the Black Box equipment then you are at about the same price and quality as Black Box.  You canusually find serial cables, 9 and 25 pin connectors, null modemadapters, tools, and gender changers at your local Radio Shack, computer store or order on-line.

         There are typically three problems that you will experience while trying toconnect serial devices:

         The RS232 standard started out with a 25 pin connector.  Most RS232connectors today are 9 pins.  Try to workwith 9 pin connectors when ever possible so convert 25 pin connectors to 9 pinconnectors using 25 pin to 9 pin adapters.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The second thing that will mess you up is whether the connectors aremale or female (pins or sockets).  Therefore it helps to have an assortmentof gender changers (male to male, female to female).  (Please -- no e-mails-- I'm not making any of this up).  Gender changers comein both 9 pin and 25 pins.  If you have changed everything from 25 pin to 9pin then you won't need many 25 pin gender changers.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The third problem is DCE &amp; DTE.  If two serial ports bothtransmit on pin 2 and receive on pin 3 (i.e. they are both DTE) and you plug in a straight throughserial cable then you will transmit into the transmit pin(not the receive pin) on the other end and the other device can't receive the data.  That is what null modem adaptersare for.  Null modem adapters swap the wire connections on pins 2 and 3(and also the handshaking lines) so that the transmitter (pin 2) goes into the receiver (pin 3)of the other device.  During the design phase you could worry yourself about this or you could just carry null modem adapters to theinstallation site with you.  Plug in the serial cable.  If it does not work theninsert the null modem adapter and then see if it works.  Note that you canbuy serial cables either straight through or null modem (crossed).
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Another trick to is to buy 9 pin RS232 to RJ45 (modular connector) adapters and thenuse regular Ethernet cable to connect the adapters.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Most RS422 and RS485 connections are done using screw terminals. Therefore you don't have to worry about gender changers andadapters.

         The first step is to get connected and test out all the low level stuff:cables, serial port hardware, serial port drivers, interrupt conflicts,etc.  The best way to do this is to attach the serial cable between twocomputers and run the HyperTerminal communications program that comes withMicrosoft Windows (Start, Programs, Accessories, Communications, HyperTerminal). You run the HyperTerminal program on both computers and should be able to typemessages into the main text box and see them appear on the other computer. You can also send text files from one computer to the other.  You can create smalltext files to send using Notepad.  Just open Notepad type in some text andsave the file.  Note that in HyperTerminalyou will have to specify the connection to be direct to COM1, COM2, ... whateverserial port you plugged the cable into.  We would initially set thecommunications parameters (on both computers) to 9600 baud, no parity, 8 databits, 1 stop bit.

         Handshaking
        </span>
       </h2>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         "Handshaking", when talking about serial communications, is how one device tells another device that it is ready to receive data.  There are several layers of handshaking.  There are the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) / Data Set Ready (DSR) lines that indicate the other device is plugged in, powered up and is present.  Then there is Request To Send (RTS) / Clear To Send (CTS) which indicates that the receiver has room in it's input buffer and is ready to accept data.  Third, there is XON and XOFF.  XON and XOFF are a method that one device can use the serial link to tell the other device to stop sending and then when to start sending again.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Suppose that there are two serial devices, A &amp; B.  Let's say that device A is a Pentium 4, 3 GHz with hyperthreading, lot's of memory and doing very little work.  It can transmit and receive very fast.  But device B is a special device with a CPU that is having to do a lot of other things and find time for serial communications.  Also, device B might have a small receive buffer.  So if device A were transmitting to device B then device A could transfer data much faster than device B could receive it.  So device B would use handshaking to tell device A when to stop sending and then when to restart.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         RTS/CTS are hardware and require wires to carry these signals between devices.  XON/XOFF are special characters sent over the serial link and do not require additional wires.  XOFF is the character CTRL-S (ASCII code 19) and XON is the character CTRL-Q (ASCII code 17).  For example, if you connect two computers with a serial cable and are able to type characters on one computer and see the characters appear on the other computer -- press CRTL-S (XOFF) on one computer to stop communications.  Type on the other computer and you should see that the characters are not transmitted.  Once you press CTRL-Q (XON) the characters should show up because they were held at the transmitting computer until XON was sent by the receiving computer.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         What if one device requires hardware handshaking and the other device can not supply it?  You must "jumper out" the hardware handshaking lines by wiring the RTS/CTS lines together and the DTR/DSR lines together.  Note that some serial ports that use DTR &amp; DSR also use Carrier Detect (CD) and will want the CD line tied into the DTR and DSR lines.

         How many times have you had two serial devices communicating and no one wants to give youthe protocol?  Okay, maybe it's just us and a few other geeks.  The way to reverse engineer the protocol is to use serialanalyzers. You can reverse engineer anything from huge old legacy systems tonew protocols.  Several companies manufacture such devices:

         These programs allow you to "break-in" between two devices andrecord everything that they send back and forth. It takes a little time andtesting to relate specific communications strings to functions but once that iscomplete, it is easy to duplicate the commands and messages in VB or C#. Writing your own serialanalyzer program is good practice and we hope we will write one in the future toput on this website.

         <span style="font-weight: 400">

           The device automatically sends you the data once every time period or test.  For example once a second or at the end of every test.

         For the first case, it is very easy to write code to receive the data and put the value into a VB / C# variable for useelsewhere in your program.  In fact the "Poor Man's Serial InstantMessenger" is a great start.  The second option (polling) is more difficultbut we provide an example later.

         The two items that determine the difficulty of implementing your ownprotocol are the number of commands youhave to program and timing issues.  Sending one command that returns onecommand (set of values) from the device is simple.  Having to program many commands withdifferent possible responses becomes challenging.  A good example of thisis the many industrial &amp; factory automation protocols in use today such asDF1 (Allen-Bradley), Modbus, and Profibus DP.  There are a lot of commandsyou can send to a device using these protocols and there are typically more thanone response you need to handle.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         The other challenging problem can be timing.  Many protocols havetiming requirements.  For example you have a maximum time betweencharacters and messages.  If you take longer than the maximum time, thereceiver has "timed out" and you have to start all over again. Today's processors are fast enough that this is not usually a problem.  Butif you are sending a single character, running code to figure out the nextcharacter, then sending another character, etc. and having a communicationsproblem -- try building the entire character string in memory first and thensending the entire string out the serial port at one time.  This reducesthe time between characters.

       <h2>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Typical Protocols
        </span>
       </h2>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         We will discuss two types of protocols: simple and complete.  Asimple protocol would something like "value" and then a carriage return&lt;CR&gt;.  The carriage return &lt;CR&gt; denotes the end of the message.  For example if you are reading values from a device and you getthe number 1 then is the actual value that the device is sending you 1, 10,1000, or any other number that starts with one?  When you receive the &lt;CR&gt; it denotes that all digits ofthe value have been sent.  So now the receiver gets a 1&lt;CR&gt;, 10&lt;CR&gt;, or1000&lt;CR&gt;and can tell that they have received all the digits and easily convert thevalue.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Note that the &lt;CR&gt; serves another purpose.  What happens if you look in your serial input buffer and it has a lot of data in it?  How do you know where to start reading data?  The trick is to start reading characters until you read a &lt;CR&gt;.  Then throw all those previous characters away (since you don't know if they are a complete message or not).  So the &lt;CR&gt; serves as both the start and the end of a message.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         What if the device is sending multiple values, such as temperature andpressure?  Then the protocol might be 115,128CR.  So now the receiverstarts reading a 1, then another 1, then a 5, then a comma, then a 1, 2, 8, andfinally a carriage return.  The logic in the receiver says read the firstvalue until you reach a comma and then start reading the second value until youreach the carriage return.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         So far the simple protocol is great -- except what happens when thetemperature is 115 and the pressure is 128 but data is "garbled" inthe transmission (when a big 200 hp motor starts up) and the receiver receives115,28&lt;CR&gt; and shuts down the process because the pressure dropped to 28 PSI? How is the receiver to know when the data is not correct?  Thatis why "complete" protocols are used -- they have more error detectionbuilt in.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         What we call a "complete" protocol is one that typically has aStart Of Text (STX), sender address, receiver address, number of data values,the data being sent, End Of Text (ETX), checksum, and then requires some form ofacknowledgement from the receiver.  This "complete" protocolprovides several things:
        </span>
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <span style="font-weight: 400">
          <span __boilernet_label="1">
           On a network with more than two devices, it allows a sender to send a message to a specific device or broadcast to all devices ( for a broadcast message the receiver address = 255 or some other predefined value).
          </span>
         </span>
        </li>
        <li>
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          The number of data values, (bytes or words) tells the receiver how many bytes of data should be received.  Knowing the structure of the message and the number of bytes allows you to see that all bytes were received.  For example if the first byte is STX, the second byte the sender, third byte the receiver, the fourth byte equals 10 for ten bytes of data, then the receiver knows that bytes five through 14 are data and that byte 15 had better be the ETX character.  If the fifteenth byte is not the ETX character then the receiver knows that it did not receive a correct message and returns a negative acknowledgement (NAK) to the sender.
         </span>
        </li>
        <li>
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          The receiver runs the checksum algorithm on the data received and compares the receiver's calculated checksum to the checksum sent by the sender.  If the checksums are equal then the receiver assumes that good data was received.  If the checksums are not equal then one or more of the characters have been "garbled".
         </span>
        </li>
        <li>
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          After all the checks are done on the receiver end, the receiver sends an ACK or NAK back to the sender to tell the sender the status.  If the receiver returns a NAK then the sender usually resends the message.  The other purpose of ACK / NAK is to tell if the receiver is still able to receive and respond to messages (the receiver has not failed).

         On the transmit (server) side it is simple to create the outgoing stringby simply concatenating the string.  On the receiver (client) side we wantto read in a string of data values and then parse the string of datavalues.  To do this we create a simple two state machine.  The firststate is "Waiting for STX" and the second state is called either"Reading Data Values" or "Waiting for ETX".  So we waitfor a STX character to be received.  When a STX character is received westart "recording" the incoming characters.  Then we stop"recording" incoming characters when a ETX character isreceived.  Once the ETX character is received we send the"recorded" string of data values to a parsing routine that picks outthe individual values.  Then the receive cycle (state machine) starts overwaiting for STX.

         This program is neat to try out using RS485.  You have one server andmultiple clients all  "daisy-chained" together and all theclients receive the data sent from the server.  However, this is apain to set-up and even we have better things to do.

          For cables that run outside the building for lightning protection you should use a full complement of surge protection such as fuses, gas discharge tubes, and semiconductor Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS).

          Keep your communication cables away from all sources of noise.  Do not run near fluorescent lights, AC power cables, DC power cables over 24 VDC, large motors, variable frequency drives, etc.  Best installation is putting communications cables in their own grounded conduit.  If you must cross AC cables then do so at right angles.

          IF you can, when reading and writing to a device, group the data into large blocks of data.  For example, if you need to read 20 temperatures from a PLC that are spread throughout the PLC memory, use PLC "move" commands to copy the temperatures to one continuous block of memory.  Now your program doing the reading only needs one read command of twenty values instead of twenty read commands of one value.  Overall system performance will be much faster.
