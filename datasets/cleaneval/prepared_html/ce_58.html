          I was trained as a graduate student to read other people's research. Then Ifinished my special field exams and was told to go write some research.

Here issome advice I found helpful when I was searching for a topic.

          : Choosing a paper topic requiresbalancing the importance and feasibility of the topic. Feasibility involvestractability for theoretical research, and data availability for empiricalresearch. I recommend creating a number of one-page paper proposals, each witha topic sentence and data source.

        <p>
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          There are several heuristics for finding researchable paper topics. One wayis to list three of four papers you like. This list may hint at the style,political point of view, level of abstraction, and methods that are appropriatefor you.

        </p>
        <p>
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Other paper ideas are motivated by bad research, not good: find statementsby policy-makers, analysts and journalists that make you angry, and find datasets to address the issue. When studying for exams, keep a list of stupidthings you read to return to during the dissertation stage.

         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Don't be afraid of normal science: repeating in a longitudinal data set whatothers have done only in the cross section. Some paper ideas are data-driven:read codebooks from a variety of data sets and see if certain questions sparkideas or tests of theories you find interesting. For every paper you read,think what else you would have done with that dataset or methodology.

          Do not fall prey, as I did, to the "magnum opus fallacy". Adissertation should be normal science that certifies your competency. Save thebig thoughts in a file, and get finished! Write an opus when you are a professor,and are being paid for it. Meanwhile, negotiate the smallest useful chunk ofthe Big Project with your dissertation advisers, and do that single piece ofresearch.

          When people evaluate you for tenure, they need to know (1) who you are, and(2) what (one or two sentences) results you are associated with.

          Authors must work hard to make their results easy to follow. Thus, tablesmust be comprehensible by themselves. That is, a reader should be able tounderstand a table without reference to the text (and preferably withoutreference to other tables). The converse rule is that the text should stand byitself, even if a reader ignores the tables.
