            Thewar begins when dad turns the thermostat down because the family room istoo warm. A few minutes later mom turns up the thermostat because the bedroomis too cold. Eventually, someone is opening a window or closing a ventto get the temperature just right, and no one is really comfortable. Butthere's a better solution than family feuds or dressing in layers.
