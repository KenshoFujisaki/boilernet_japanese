          This chain intimates that after several significant terrorist attacks, President Bill Clinton promised justice would be done, but failed to deliver on those promises. The conclusion is drawn that, had Clinton been tougher on terrorists, the attacks of September 11, 2001, never would have happened. Post 9/11 investigations into intelligence breakdowns have indicated that both the Clinton and Bush administrations are guilty of ignoring warning signs of this tragedy and opportunities to stop it.

         The September 11 attacks were the result of many years of planning by various individuals and groups with an ages-old agenda to fulfill. Terrorism has been around for centuries and has survived decades upon decades of being "hunted down and punished." The mindsets of those who committed these crimes is deep-seeded in history. It's unlikely that they were significantly encouraged by one man's failure to retaliate. This chain letter's simplification of the attacks to a case of "bad parenting" practically excuses extremist terrorists as spoiled children whose misbehavior was not adequately corrected by a lax father.

          As a nation searches for justice for the most heinous act of cowardice ever committed on citizens, we are eager to pin the blame on anyone. But blaming the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on Clinton is an insult to those innocent people who died - reducing their tragic deaths to just one more example of how inept Clinton was. What possible purpose does this chain serve except to deflect attention, hatred and blame from the real monsters behind this tragedy? And now, someone is using it to stump for Bush in an election year? Please, Break this chain!
