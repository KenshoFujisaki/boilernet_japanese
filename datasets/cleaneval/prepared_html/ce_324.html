      The adjective "aromatic" is used by organic chemists in a rather different way than it is normally applied. It has its origin in the observation that certain natural substances, such as cinnamon bark, wintergreen leaves, vanilla beans and anise seeds, contained fragrant compounds having common but unexpected properties. Cinnamon bark, for example, yielded a pleasant smelling compound, formula C

      O, named cinnamaldehyde. Because of the low hydrogen to carbon ratio in this and other aromatic compounds (note that the H:C ratio in an alkane is &gt;2), chemists expected their structural formulas would contain a large number of double or triple bonds. Since double bonds are easily cleaved by oxidative reagents such as potassium permanganate or ozone, and rapidly add bromine and chlorine, these reactions were applied to these aromatic compounds. Surprisingly, products that appeared to retain many of the double bonds were obtained, and these compounds exhibited a high degree of chemical stability compared with known alkenes and cycloalkenes (

      Here, two structurally and energetically equivalent electronic structures for a stable compound are written, but no single structure provides an accurate or even an adequate representation of the true molecule. The six-membered ring in benzene is a perfect hexagon (all carbon-carbon bonds have an identical length of 1.40 �). The cyclohexatriene contributors would be expected to show alternating bond lengths, the double bonds being shorter (1.34 �) than the single bonds (1.54 �). An alternative representation for benzene (circle within a hexagon) emphasizes the pi-electron delocalization in this molecule, and has the advantage of being a single diagram. In cases such as these, the electron delocalization described by resonance enhances the stability of the molecules, and compounds composed of such molecules often show exceptional stability and related properties.

      Evidence for the enhanced thermodynamic stability of benzene was obtained from measurements of the heat released when double bonds in a six-carbon ring are hydrogenated (hydrogen is added catalytically) to give cyclohexane as a common product. In the following diagram cyclohexane represents a low-energy reference point. Addition of hydrogen to cyclohexene produces cyclohexane and releases heat amounting to 28.6 kcal per mole. If we take this value to represent the energy cost of introducing one double bond into a six-carbon ring, we would expect a cyclohexadiene to release 57.2 kcal per mole on complete hydrogenation, and 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene to release 85.8 kcal per mole. These

      The first three compounds (cyclic polyenes) have properties associated with alkenes in general. Each reacts readily with bromine to give addition products, as do most alkenes. The thermodynamic change on introducing double bonds into the carbon atom ring is also typical of alkenes (a destabilization of ca. 26 kcal/mol for each double bond). Conjugation offsets this increase in energy by a small amount (4-6 kcal/mol).

      The remaining four compounds exhibit very different properties, and are considered aromatic. Benzene and pyridine are relatively unreactive with bromine, requiring heat and/or catalysts to force reaction, the result of which is substitution rather than addition. Furan and pyrrole react more rapidly with bromine, but they also give substitution products. This tendency to favor substitution rather than addition suggests that the parent unsaturated ring system has exceptional stability. Thermodynamic measurements support this conclusion. The enhanced stability, often referred to as

Bonds and electron pairs that are not part of the aromatic annulene are black. The first example is imidazole, a heterocycle having two nitrogen atoms. Note that only one of the nitrogen non-bonding electron pairs is used for the aromatic ?-electron sextet. The other electron pair (colored black) behaves similarly to the electron pair in pyridine. The second and third compounds have ten-membered rings, which are forced to be planar, or nearly planar, by the bridging bond or methylene group. These are 10 ?-electron systems that fit the aromaticity requirements. Finally, the last example has a fourteen-membered ring with 7 double bonds. The bridging atoms and bonds force it to be planar.

Some annulenes are aromatic (e.g. benzene), but many are not due to non-planarity or a failure to satisfy the H�ckel Rule.

      Conjugated ring systems having 4n ?-electrons (e.g. 4, 8, 12 etc. electrons) not only fail to show any aromatic properties, but appear to be less stable and more reactive than expected. As noted above, 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene is non-planar and adopts a tub-shaped conformation. The compound is readily prepared, and undergoes addition reactions typical of alkenes. Catalytic hydrogenation of this tetraene produces cyclooctane. Planar bridged annulenes having 4n ?-electrons have proven to be relatively unstable. Examples of 8 and 12-?-electron systems are shown below, together with a similar 10 ?-electron aromatic compound.

      of nucleophilic anions markedly influences their reactivity. The nucleophilicities cited above were obtained from reactions in methanol solution. Polar, protic solvents such as water and alcohols solvate anions by hydrogen bonding interactions, as shown in the diagram on the right. These solvated species are more stable and less reactive than the unsolvated "naked" anions. Polar, aprotic solvents such as DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), DMF (dimethylformamide) and acetonitrile do not solvate anions nearly as well as methanol, but provide good solvation of the accompanying cations. Consequently, most of the nucleophiles discussed here react more rapidly in solutions prepared from these solvents. These solvent effects are more pronounced for small basic anions than for large weakly basic anions. Thus, for reaction in DMSO solution we observe the following reactivity order:

      Reactions #2 and #3 are two-step sequences. In the former addition reaction,bromine (an electrophile) attacks the nucleophilic double bondof 1-butene to give an electrophilic cyclic-bromonium intermediate (enclosedin square brackets) accompanied by a nucleophilic bromide ion. This ion-pair is very short-lived, another nucleophile-electrophilebonding reaction leads to the product (1,2-dibromobutane). Inreaction #3 (a substitution reaction) the electrophilic carbonyl carbon atom bonds to thenucleophilic oxygen atom of ethyl alcohol to give an intermediate (insquare brackets) that eliminates HCl, yielding the ester ethyl acetate. Inall of these examples the reactivity of the electrophiles andnucleophiles is sufficient to allow reaction to proceed spontaneouslyat room temperature.

      The factors that influence such differences in reactivity may be complex, but in the above cases are largely due to a poor anionic leaving group (eq. 4); aromatic stabilization and reduced nucleophilicity of a conjugated ?-electron system (eq. 5); and reduced electrophilic character of a substituted carbonyl group (eq. 6).

      The key factor here is the stability of the leaving anion (chloridevs. hydroxide). We know that HCl is a much stronger acid thanwater (by more than 15 powers of ten), and this difference willbe reflected in reactions that generate their conjugate bases. Thus, chloride anion is much more stable and less reactive than is hydroxide anion, so the former is a better and more common leaving group. Indeed,the failure of alcohols to undergo S

      In the case of reaction #5, the aromatic stabilization of the benzenering makes it less susceptible to attack by electrophiles thanare simple alkenes. Thus, elemental bromine is not sufficientlyelectrophilic to induce a reaction with benzene, even though thelatter is nucleophilic.

      Lastly, reactions #3 and #6 illustrate differences in the reactivity ofcarbonyl compounds. We know that the carbon atom of a carbonylgroup is electrophilic and undergoes reaction with a variety ofnucleophiles. However, this electrophilic character may be enhancedor diminished by substituents. If we take saturated aldehydes (RCH=O) as a reference, the additional alkyl substituent present in ketonesslightly reduces this electrophilicity, but the general reactivitypattern of these classes is similar. On the other hand, a chlorinesubstituent is inductively electron withdrawing and increasesthe electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon significantly. Thus,acid chlorides are very reactive with a wide range of nucleophiles,including water and alcohols (eq. 3).

      The oxygen and nitrogen substituents present in esters and amideshave a similar inductive effect, but also a pronounced electrondonating character through a resonance interaction. Consequently, the carbonyl carbon atom becomes less electrophilic, and these functional groups are less reactive than other carbonylcompounds. Thus, the failure of ethyl acetateto react with water (eq. 6) reflects the reduced electrophilic character of its carbonyl group.

      Fortunately, these retarding factors can often be overcome by acid or base catalysis, which in general enhances electrophilicity (acids) or nucleophilicity (bases). Equations 7 through 9 show how this tactic may be effectively applied to the unreactive examples given above.
