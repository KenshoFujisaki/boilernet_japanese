        Regrettably, neither Barbara nor I are ableto claim that the third non-reader is one of us. What can I say byway of excuse for this? I found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about to leave on a trip to Europe. I bought it for the long, long flights that lay ahead of us, without knowing much about it except that it was supposed to be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuffand the blurbs said it was great. I didn't open it, I just grabbed oneoff a pallet of about 500 copies.Barbara was between mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from meand rapidly read it over the next couple of daysbefore we even left for the airport. I asked hopefully what it was like. She scowled and said something about the Hardy Boys.My heart sank; I understood her to mean it was pathetic butpossibly of interest to the 11-year-old market. By the time we wereon our plane she had made sure thather flight bag contained a new novel by

          Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-oldman heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.

        I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to spenda number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in thehistory of literature was this. Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalisticstories about deaths; you just don't do it in describing an event in a narrative. So this might be reasonabletext for the opening of a newspaper report the next day:
       </span>

      <blockquote>

        sequence — details of not only his protagonist's profession but also his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here.It has the ring of utter ineptitude. The details have no relevance, of course, to what is being narrated (Saunière isfleeing an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarmsystem and the security gates). We could have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact that he wascurating at the Louvre.

      <p>
       <span __boilernet_label="1">
        The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and wordchoice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line). Look at the phrase "the seventy-six-year-old man".It's a complete let-down: we knew he was a man — the anaphoric pronoun "he" had just been used to refer to him. (This is perhaps where "curator" could have been slipped in for thefirst time, without "renowned", if the passage were rewritten.)Look at "heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas." We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of credentials, for heaven's sake). Surely "toward him" feels better than "toward himself" (though I guess both are grammatical here). Surely "tore from the wall" shouldbe "tore away from the wall". Surely a single man can't fall into aheap (there's only him, that's not a heap). And why repeat the name"Saunière" here instead of the pronoun "he"? Who else is around? (Caravaggio hasn't been mentioned; "aCaravaggio" uses the name as an attributive modifier with conventionallyelided head noun "painting". That isn't a mention of the man.)

        Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily,thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared withalternatives. I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill, andit never gets much better. Why did I keep reading? Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International, and airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood drivel on a smallscreen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal, that's why.And why did I keep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrowtrash bin? Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessonsin how not to write.

        I don't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time novelist, it would seem a cruel blow to a budding career. But Dan Brown is all over the best-seller lists now. In paperback and hardback, and in manylanguages, he is a phenomenon. He is up there with the Stephen Kingsand the John Grishams and nothing I say can conceivably harm him. He isa huge, blockbuster, worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants andneed never work again. And he writes like the kind of freshman student who makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching. Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and puzzle clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible, terrible example of the thriller-writer's craft.
