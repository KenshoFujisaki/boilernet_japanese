          he Awards and Recognitions page of Andrea Michaels� bio sheet reads like that of any legendary athlete or thespian. To say she has left an indelible mark on the event industry would be an understatement.

         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Entering her third decade as an event planner and producer, Michaels has climbed to the top of her profession armed with a clear sense of purpose and an unwavering event philosophy that says if you take the time to truly understand the client�s intent, then you hold the key to creating a successful and memorable event.

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          "I�m famous for saying, �Sell the client what they want to buy and not what you want to sell them,�" she says. "Every event has a purpose, even if it�s not an obvious one. And delivering that purpose successfully is the one and only true key."

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Michaels� ability to conceptualize an event and then exceed customer expectations has been her hallmark and a primary reason why she has produced events around the world and coveted accounts, such as 20th Century Fox, NASA, Pepsi, Eastman Kodak, Mercedes-Benz and Microsoft, continue to contract her services.

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Besides her proven track record, Michaels has a background in entertainment and holds a master�s degree in psychology�both of which play important roles when dealing with customers and planning events.

          Michaels has said that she approaches each function as if it were a play, complete with an overture, acts and a finale. Like a theatrical production, a Michaels-produced event is designed to provide its audience with a sense of anticipation, building in excitement and enjoyment before finally ending with a distinct and satisfying conclusion.
         </span>
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          "I want each and every element of any project I�m involved in to have content and meaning and a personal experience for everyone in the audience," comments Michaels. "In Vancouver (for the opening of GM Place), when the owners and managers of the arena said, �I want the audience to cry,� I remembered that in each and every element. The orchestration of what we did was so emotional and impactful that you could watch 22,000 people weeping as they stood and applauded. It was about how the entire event was constructed, flowing and building continuously until you could almost see hearts pounding with energy, excitement and, best of all, emotional investment. Just thinking about it still gives me chills."
         </span>
        </font>

       <p>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Although she is admittedly her own worst critic, which is enough of a barometer to judge the relative success of any event with which she is involved, Michaels does have a simple formula for measuring achievement. "Success is when the audience smiles, applauds and, best of all, years later�remembers."

          here's something about a live audience. Street performers, stand-up comedians and stage actors are all drawn to the immediacy and intimacy a captive audience provides. They thrive on crowd-generated electricity and will sink or swim depending on people's instantaneous reactions. The same can be said for those involved in event planning and production. The hint of danger that every live event carries provides an adrenaline rush that would be the envy of Evel Knievel or any death-defying X-Gamer. Once they taste it, many can't shake it. They're inexplicably hooked.

          Jack Morton caught the bug at an early age and, 80 years later, still hasn't got it out of his system. Born the son of a sharecropper in North Carolina, Morton quickly developed a love for theater and stepped into show business as a 12-year-old, working as an usher, ticket taker, bill poster and sometime janitor in a small-town, silent-movie house. At 18, he was managing an 850-seat theater and helped usher in talking pictures for his loyal clientele.

          The Depression years took Morton to Washington, D.C., where he worked his way through George Washington University. Before long, he was organizing and booking dance bands for school dances, society affairs and even presidents.

          His experience in theater and music allowed him to begin producing shows for the burgeoning convention industry, and in 1939, Morton founded Jack Morton Productions as primarily an entertainment production company. Today, known as Jack Morton Worldwide, the company has grown into a 25-office, worldwide agency, boasting 800 employees working on four continents.

          The company has been a rousing success, in part, because it has never lost sight of the original ideals Morton instilled back in 1939. Then and now, the live experience is the very essence of any work the company performs for its clients.

          "In whatever form it comes-be it theater, a meeting, Webcast, or one-on-one conversation-a live experience creates the best learning environment," says Morton, who also credits his company's longevity and growth to its ability to continually adapt and expand capabilities to meet customer needs.

          Jack Morton Worldwide has grown to be a leader in experiential brand communications and continues to evolve by utilizing new areas such as mobile marketing and Webcasts. Regardless of the medium, whether coordinating broadcasts via the Internet or selecting music rolls for a player piano, the keys to creating a memorable event have remained remarkably similar to when Morton first started in that North Carolina theater: set measurable objectives, respect the brand and engage the audience.

          Morton continues to champion the latter as the ultimate measuring stick for an event's success. At 92, the live experience still holds a powerful allure. "The reaction of a live audience is real," he says. "There's no better measurement than what you can see or hear from a live participant."

          ay Thompson grew up in a family of eight children. As a child, he loved to tinker with the parts from discarded vending machines from his father's business. By the time he was in the fifth grade, he had created and installed a bank of 15 colored spotlights in the wall of his room and built a system to play the lights with music, shooting color out into the room. As a sophomore in, he designed and built a complete lighting system for the stage at his high school. Clearly, he had found his destiny early in life.

          Thompson founded Images By Lighting in 1983, and was truly one of the industry pioneers in the ways he has used lighting to enhance, accentuate and add excitement to the world of events. "It was always about lighting to me. I loved it. It was in my heart," says Thompson.

          When Thompson graduated from the University of Central Florida with an electrical engineering degree, he says, "I decided if I was going to find my destiny, it would be in Los Angeles, and I accepted a job offer from Hughes Aircraft."

          While working in Los Angeles, he designed a lighting project for a friend in Beverly Hills. His friend's friends quickly discovered his talent for lighting, leading to a variety of home and commercial lighting projects. Movie producer Allen Carr was so impressed with Thompson's work in his (Carr's) home that in 1984 he asked Thompson to design the lighting for one of his premiers. The success of the premier led Thompson to team up with the some of the top designers, planners and companies, whose visions gave birth to the event industry as we know it today.

          Along this storied journey to his Hall of Fame inauguration, Thompson's projects have taken him to countries all over the globe, and across the United States and Canada.

          More importantly, many top designers and producers look to Thompson when they need their event to be edgy or over-the-top! "I work with designers, decorators and scenic designers who are creating worlds," he explains. "I am there to support them. I want people to see the magic."

          Thompson and Images by Lighting's excellence has earned numerous prestigious honors and awards. When asked for advice, he says, "I never take so much business that it compromises the quality. I always give something extra to the client that they did not expect. I do that with lighting some aspect of the event that I find is special to me. It is my passion to be able to create with light."

          r. Joe Goldblatt graduated from college in 1975 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater and business. "I wanted to pursue events as a profession, but there was nothing... no official college program... in events," Goldblatt recollects.

          Through this, Goldblatt met his wife, Nancy, who taught clowning and was a performing artist. He reminisces, "We fell in love, got married and started performing as mimes as part of the Artists in our Schools program." For two years, they traveled to schools nationwide, but when Nancy became pregnant, they decided, " ... it was best if we did not travel with our son."

         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          The Goldblatt's began entertaining at special events held by Washington area shopping centers. Their successful performances evolved into producing shopping center events and starting their own company: The Wonder Company, Inc. "Our real motivation was to stay home with our child; to have as normal a family life as possible."

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          As The Wonder Company grew, they added staff. Goldblatt developed training procedures for their staff and freelancers. "I developed a training program, so that I could manage the business and send trained staffers out to produce events while I stayed in Washington with my family."
         </span>

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          The Wonder Company grew in size and reputation. Goldblatt again found himself on the road, away from his family. So, he sold The Wonder Company to a decorating firm in Nashville, relocated there and worked for the new owner a year. With the downturn of the economy, the new owner defaulted and The Wonder Company returned to Goldblatt.

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          Simultaneously, Goldblatt began his career as an expert witness in the field of events. As he researched cases, the quantity of information available inspired him to develop a curriculum for professional event planners, including writing the necessary texts for instruction.

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          In 1992, he began exploring colleges and universities as possible sites for this curriculum. The George Washington University (GW) deservedly offered Goldblatt a full scholarship to earn his master's degree and doctorate, plus resources to develop his program, office space and library support.

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          From 1993 to 2001, the GW program grew from 25 students to 4000. Goldblatt then licensed it as the Event Management Certificate Program to 20 other universities around the world.

       <p>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          When asked why he felt so passionately about creating this Event Management Certificate Program and the ISES Certified Special Events Professional (CSEP) professional designation, Goldblatt responded, "I knew that every industry, in order to be taken seriously, needs a certification program."
         </span>

       <p>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <span __boilernet_label="1">
          In 2001, Johnson and Wales University, with 15,000 students of hospitality, recruited Goldblatt. "They wanted to draw on my expertise in events to develop their program," he comments.

          Johnson and Wales also made Goldblatt the Dean of the Alan Shawn Feinstein Graduate School, and today, Goldblatt, affectionately known as Dr. Joe, continues to inspire hospitality students and faculty alike. Goldblatt is also an internationally recognized speaker and has received numerous awards for his work, including his induction into the 2002 Event Industry Hall of Fame.

          Daly reflects upon his global body of work. �Overseas, they don�t do events the same way we do, because they haven�t seen it,� he says. �But once they see what we are doing�it�s amazing. They really get on board once they understand it. You can�t translate a feeling, but you can translate art. Art has a language of its own.� Daly thrives on the interaction with artists of different cultures and languages. He thrills at developing the common communication between himself and the artists, and realizing the vision together.

          �I happened to be at the right place at the right time. From delivering, I began to freelance in floral design. I also worked for what they called at that time a �party shop� that did a lot of weddings and parties.�

          In the early to mid �70s, at a time when no such thing existed, Daly decided to open his own company, strictly an event company. �Everybody thought I was absolutely crazy to consider such a thing!� He started with 300 square feet of workspace. Within four years, he took over the whole building, ran a fleet of trucks, and had built his team to 35 people.

          Daly�s team continuously took events to new levels. There were no specialty linen companies then; they made their own linens. There were no prop houses; they made their own props. �People were stunned, totally stunned. That�s why it worked,� Daly mused while considering the early days.

              I worked with Ray Thompson on an event for Gillette during the World Cup in 1998. We were in Paris, at Chantilly, a place like a miniature Versailles. We created Chantilly as it would have looked during the reign of Louis XIV. We re-landscaped the gardens, installed fountains in the lakes, and filled all the urns with floral arrangements. The guests swept down on an 80-foot by 150-foot long staircase to the sounds of baroque music and a water show. The event was two years in the making. Then all of a sudden, it was there, and it was exactly as we had pictured it.

              The �worst� began as we were leaving for an event in Hawaii. I locked my keys and the tickets for a crew of 15 in my car, while it was still running. Then, on the island, a hurricane blew in and tore down every single thing we had put up. The rains came. We had roofs blown into the tent. I had ordered thousands of dollars of foliage for the ceiling. It arrived in one small box. So my crew went into the jungle with machetes to chop greens. Two minutes before the guests were to enter, the power was disconnected, and we had to rewire the tent. Finally, as we were packing up the boxes to leave, a bellman was helping with his box cutter. He cut one of my guy�s fingers nearly off. We don�t talk about that event.

But I transferred to USC after creating an explosion in a chemistry class that required a building to be evacuated. I did much better at USC because I only started a fire in the lab there. A woman dropped something on my shoe which caught on fire,� says Shapiro.

          Born in Boston, raised during his teen years in Fort Wayne, Ind., Steeg, the son of an engineering professor at Purdue, grew up a sports fanatic. His favorite memory? At age 9 in 1960, he skipped a day of fifth grade so he could sit in right field at Fenway Park for Ted Williams� final game.

          After receiving a bachelor�s degree in political science from Miami University in 1972, followed by an MBA in finance from Wake Forest in 1975, Steeg was unexcited at the prospect of working for an accounting firm. He wrote to every professional sports team in the country, except those in New York. In July �75, the Miami Dolphins hired him as an accountant. Within four years, Steeg was the team�s business manager.

Also, Steeg directs league-sponsored Super Bowl charitable events, raising millions of dollars for programs in local host communities.

         hen you stop everything to watch the Super Bowl halftime show, spectacular Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies, or are thrilled by a live event production, you experience the legacy of David L. Wolper. In addition to raising the bar and setting the standard for live event extravaganzas, Wolper�s impressive list of credits includes documentaries, sit-coms, docudramas, and films ranging from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, recreating each genre in the process.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         At the 1939 World�s Fair in New York, Wolper�s life changed when he witnessed his first television broadcast at the RCA exhibit. TV would shape his future, and he would ultimately shape the future of the medium, raising the world�s expectations of entertainment.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Wolper was born in New York in 1928, roughly four months after television was first demonstrated. While growing up, he earned money selling radishes, delivering flowers, and bussing tables. Even then his flair for show business manifested itself, as he promoted local big bands and held entertainment-connected odd jobs, such as Arthur Murray dance instructor, usher at a Broadway theater, and seating guests at a stylish canteen.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Although Wolper began college at Drake University in Iowa, he transferred to the University of Southern California, which at the time housed the nation�s only film school. Wolper also played baseball, wrote for the university humor magazine and shot photos for the USC newspaper.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         He showed his inventive humor by showing up uninvited to the Academy Awards with a friend who was dressed in a gorilla suit. The stunt was part of a publicity campaign in which he also produced several theatrical scenarios to get students to attend a play written by a friend.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         In 1949, Wolper decided to leave school to develop his vision for TV. His first entrepreneurial adventure involved buying and reinventing documentaries for the small screen. These were Wolper�s first steps in presenting information as entertainment.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         His list of credits is a virtual stroll through history. He brought imagination to history and reality to imagination. Throughout his career, Wolper has implemented new techniques, mixing a variety of media into film to properly convey a story.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         This year, USC opened The David Wolper Center in celebration of his 50th anniversary in entertainment. The center contains many of Wolper�s personal and professional archives, including scripts, awards, business records and physical documentation of events that transformed the nation�s psyche.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span __boilernet_label="1">
         Throughout his career, Wolper�s vision, energy and innovative spirit have impacted people�s perspective and perception of what it means to be entertained. His lifetime of creativity has rewarded him with more than 90 prestigious awards, including three Oscars and 50 Emmys. As one of the original visionaries in the industry, his legacy is the gift of joy, fascination and wonder.
