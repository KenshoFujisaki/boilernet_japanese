A CD-ROM version of the Red List was produced in 2000 and funds permitting, a new version will be produced in the future. The information presented is based on data extracted from the SSC Species Information Service (SIS) Red List database maintained by the IUCN SSC Red List Programme Office in Cambridge, UK. The information provided here covers all taxa that have been assigned an IUCN Red List Category with the exception of those designated as Not Evaluated (NE). All the assessments presented, except those for geographically isolated subpopulations or stocks, are for the taxon (species, subspecies or variety) as a whole (i.e. they indicate the global risk of extinction). No national or regional Red List assessments are included, except for national extinctions (where known) and an occasional note about national or sub-national status in one of the documentation fields.

               The SSC Red List Programme has developed a set of minimum documentation requirements that were introduced in 2000. Anyone making submissions for inclusion on the Red List is requested to provide (in addition to the usual details about name, status, criteria and distribution) a justification to support the listing; a map of the extent of occurrence; a list of the major habitats the species is found in; what the major threats are; an indication as to whether the species' population trend is increasing, decreasing, stable or unknown; what conservation actions are in place or are needed; and information on the utilization of the species. Non-mandatory information is also collected on life history attributes, the value of species for human livelihoods and the importance of species to ecosystem processes. If the taxon assessed falls within the jurisdiction of an appointed Red List Authority then it will be referred to them for evaluation (for further details about Red List Authorities and how to submit assessments see the

                implies that the primary focus is at the species level, the IUCN Red List also includes assessments that are done at the infra-specific or subpopulation levels. Ideally, for such taxa to be included in the Red List, the global status of the species itself should be assessed. In most instances this is the case and generally these are assessed as Least Concern (LR/lc or LC). There are some cases, however, especially amongst the plants where this has not been done and it may well be that some of these species warrant a threatened status. For subpopulations (also called stocks), only geographically isolated subpopulations, between which there is little genetic exchange (typically one migrant individual or gamete per year), are included on the IUCN Red List.

                In the 2000 version of the Red List, all searches produced combined results for species, subspecies, varieties and subpopulations. In many cases users only wanted species-level information and if the lists were very long this was often difficult to extract. The default search options now provide results at the species level only. Searches for subspecies, varieties and subpopulations have to be specified separately. If assessments for subspecies, varieties or subpopulations are available, these are clearly indicated from the detailed results pages of the species concerned.

The TDWG geographic system also provides a standard set of Basic Recording Units (BRU) that are sub-country units based on provinces or states. The BRU's are used to subdivide very large countries like Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, etc. into smaller more conveniently sized units for recording distributions. This system has been adopted for the IUCN Red List wherever possible. Most plant taxa on the Red List have had their distributions recorded down to BRU level where appropriate, but unfortunately sub-country information is still lacking for most of the animal species. Hence this feature is not currently searchable. Each country or territory has also been assigned to a single geographic region to enable users to search by larger geographic areas. (View the list of

               Geopolitical events during recent years may have led to some inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided. Within reasonable limits every effort has been made to determine which of the new nations that were part of the former Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and USSR support species previously attributed to the larger unit. There may be some species in the Red List that have still not been fully resolved. Adherence to the ISO system also creates some problems, as there is often a time lag between a political change and a new ISO code being allocated for the new country. The version of the ISO codes used for example, maintains Hong Kong and Macao as separate units.
