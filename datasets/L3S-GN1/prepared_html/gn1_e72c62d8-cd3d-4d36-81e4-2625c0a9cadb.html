       NEWCASTLE, England - Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce left the club "by mutual agreement" Wednesday after just eight months in charge.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Allardyce had been jeered by fans this season after failing to impress with his favoured style of play, a direct, combative approach that brought him relative success at Bolton. He won just eight of his 24 matches at Newcastle, while losing 10.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "The decision has been reached by mutual agreement," Newcastle said in a statement on its website.

       Many fans want former striker and captain Alan Shearer to take over despite him having no managerial experience.

       "A new manager has not yet been appointed at Newcastle United," Newcastle chairman Chris Mort said. "We will make a further announcement on the managerial position when appropriate."

       Newcastle's 0-0 draw at League Championship club Stoke on Sunday stretched its winless streak to five matches.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Allardyce, who spent eight years at Bolton, had been appointed to help lift Newcastle and challenge for titles, but the team is 11th in the 20-team Premier League with 26 points, 24 less than leader Arsenal.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "I am disappointed to be leaving Newcastle United but I wish the club all the best for the remainder of the season and for the future," Allardyce said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Allardyce was Newcastle's sixth full-time manager since Kevin Keegan left the club in 1997. Kenny Dalglish, Ruud Gullit, Bobby Robson, Graeme Souness and Glenn Roeder also led the team since then.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Allardyce is the eighth manager to leave a Premier League club so far this season, either by mutual consent or dismissal. The others were Lawrie Sanchez of Fulham, Chelsea's Jose Mourinho, Tottenham's Martin Jol, Bolton's Sammy Lee, Wigan's Chris Hutchings, Derby's Billy Davies and Steve Bruce of Birmingham.
