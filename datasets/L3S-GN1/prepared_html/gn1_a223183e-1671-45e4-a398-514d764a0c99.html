      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       But world number two and top seed Rafael Nadal of Spain had no problems in disposing of unfancied Mathieu Montcourt of France 6-2, 6-4 later in the evening.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Haase, who had lost in three sets in his only other meeting with Baghdatis, let slip five match points in the 10th game of the second set before wrapping up the match with a forehand cross-court shot.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "Baghdatis is a great player but I was plain lucky that he was not at his best today," said the 20-year-old Haase.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "When you play a great player like him, you have to raise your own game and I am happy I was able to pass the test."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Baghdatis, who also lost in the first round in his previous appearance in the tournament in 2005, said he was not disheartened by the shock defeat.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "It was the first match of the season and I was coming back after two months off the circuit," he said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "I was unable to play as well as I am capable of but I am certain I will pick up as the days pass and be prepared for the Australian Open."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "There was no problem with the court, weather or anything like that. He just played better than me and took the chances that came his way," the 2006 Australian Open finalist added.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Nadal said he felt sad for "good friend" Baghdatis because his attractive strokeplay would have delighted the Chennai crowd.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "His defeat takes something out of the tournament but it also shows how strong the field is," the Spaniard said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       The only time Nadal stuttered against the 123rd-ranked Montcourt was when he was serving for the match at 5-2 in the second set.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Nadal wasted four match points on the way to dropping his serve, but took the match on his next service game to advance to the second round.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "Except for those last three games I think I played well," he said. "Nothing seemed to work for me at the end and he was also playing better at that stage.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "But I am happy to have the first match out of the way and look forward to the rest of the tournament."
