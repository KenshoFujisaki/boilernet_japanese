       Last week, a metropolitan sessions judge in Dhaka said police evidence put before the court was grounds to continue the trial and formally indict her on corruption charges. Sheikh Hasina will be tried by a special fast-track tribunal set up by the military-backed government as part of its anti-graft drive.

       Officials said that under the country's penal code, she faced a maximum 14 years in jail if convicted. The trial would be concluded within the next two months, as required under the country's emergency rules.
