               Marion Jones had to give up her gold medals. Barry Bonds might get an asterisk next to his home run record. And imagine Mary J. Blige having to hand over her Grammys.

               In a bizarre twist on the performance-enhancing scandal that has tarnished numerous sports, several well-known musicians entered the fray last weekend when The Times Union of Albany, N.Y., reported that Blige, 50 Cent, Wyclef Jean and Timbaland were among thousands of people whose names surfaced in an Albany-based investigation into obtaining steroids and human growth hormone.
              </span>

              <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
               Citing information from sources, the newspaper said the prescribed drugs were shipped to the celebrities under fictitious names ? 50 Cent?s shipment was supposedly mailed under the moniker Michael Jordan and one of Blige?s shipments sent to Marlo Stanfield, the drug kingpin from HBO?s series The Wire. None of the musicians has been charged with breaking the law, although there should be a stiff penalty for poor pseudonym use.

              <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
               While Blige?s name comes as a surprise, anyone who follows music, at least visually, should have no problem reconciling 50 Cent?s massive pecs and Timbaland?s Popeye biceps to synthetic tinkering. On the cover of his latest CD The Massacre, a shirtless and ripped 50 Cent looks more prepared to wrestle a charging rhino than drop a rhyme to get the party started.

               Steroids and human growth hormone won?t help musicians stay on key or write deeper lyrics ? Hendrix would not have dazzled more at Monterey had he dropped steroids instead of acid ? but they could provide a marketing and image boost, especially in the macho world of hip hop, where street cred is a selling point.

               Actually, the connection between performance enhancers and non-athletes is an established one, documented in statistics that show many high school age boys who take the stuff aren?t looking to star on the football team, but just look more jacked on the beach.

               Pro wrestlers, bodybuilders and police officers are among the groups often linked with steroid use, and it wouldn?t be a stretch to throw the cast of American Gladiators (new and old) into the urine vial as well. And ever wonder how scrawny actors transition into buff action heroes before becoming scrawny again? Hint: 30 pounds of fat-free muscle won?t materialize in two months, no matter how demanding the trainer and how frequent the protein shakes.

               After being caught with human growth hormone in Australia last year, Sylvester Stallone said he needed the drugs to treat his body for a slowdown of his own pituitary gland?s production of the hormone. Now 61, Stallone has cinematic reasons as well: He?s still making Rocky and Rambo movies.

               While athletes, particularly baseball players, continue to receive the most attention, the Albany investigation is a reminder that the illegal performance-enhancing problem isn?t limited to one sport, or one profession. Trying to add a few more miles an hour to a fastball is one reason some people go on the juice; trying to look more brawny on stage or screen is apparently another.
