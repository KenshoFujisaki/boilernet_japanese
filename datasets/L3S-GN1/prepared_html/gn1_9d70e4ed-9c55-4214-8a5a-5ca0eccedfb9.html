       ROME (AFP) ? Any doubts about whether or not former three-time world player of the year Ronaldo can still be a force in football were dispelled in just over 45 minutes on Sunday.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       That was the time it took for Ronaldo to score twice and set up a third as AC Milan finally managed to secure their first home league win of the season.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       After five draws, two defeats and a paltry three goals during the first half of the season, Napoli were the unfortunate victims as Milan scorched to a 5-2 victory.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       It wasn't just about Ronaldo, though, as the European champions' new Brazilian attacking triumverate 'Ka-Pa-Ro' (Kaka, Pato and Ronaldo) combined for four of the five goals.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Fans have been talking about Milan's 21st century equivalent to their famous 1950s Swedish 'Gre-No-Li' partnership (Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm), and they didn't disappoint.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       But it was the form of Ronaldo that most delighted Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       He latched onto an Andrea Pirlo pass to score the first goal, twice teed up Pato before Clarence Seedorf scored the second and then headed home a sumptuous cross from Seedorf 30 seconds after the break to notch the match-winner.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "We were fantastic, particularly Ronaldo," gushed Ancelotti.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "He is a phenomenon and he proved it even though he wasn't in great shape.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "Ronaldo started training on January 2 after six months of injuries. I'm happy for him, he's suffered a lot."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Ancelotti thrust Pato straight into the starting line-up for his debut and restored Ronaldo despite the striker - once unkindly nicknamed 'El Gordo' ('Fatty') during his time at Real Madrid - playing only 45 minutes of a friendly since his only other appearance of the season in late November.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "We took a risky attacking approach but it was vital as we need to claw back points," added the coach, alluding to Milan's 12th place in the league and 25-point deficit to leaders and bitter city rivals Inter Milan.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       He was also delighted with Pato's contribution. The 18-year-old looked to be struggling a little before the break, missing two one-on-one chances in quick succession at one point.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       But he grew as the game went on and took his chance with aplomb.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "Pato? He's got great ability. It was his first game, there's certain things to improve on but he proved he is very, very good."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Pato was delighted with how his first game went but he still deferred to his hero and strike partner.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "The team played really well," he said. "I want to dedicate my goal to my family and my girlfriend.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "Ronaldo is the true phenomenon, not me. I'm really happy to have scored. How many more can I get? I'll go to bed and have a think about that and talk about it another time."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       Ronaldo may have won the plaudits from his own team but visiting coach Edy Reja was most impressed by Pato.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span __boilernet_label="1" class="x-nc-sel2">
       "I thought he would show his inexperience but instead he showed great maturity and mental strength," said Reja.
