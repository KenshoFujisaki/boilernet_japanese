                 NEW YORK (AP) - Andrew Morton, author of "Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography," published by St. Martin's Press, alleges that the 45-year-old actor ranks second in command in the Church of Scientology.

                 The book, which came out this week, also alleges that some Scientologists believe that Cruise's daughter Suri was conceived using frozen sperm from Scientology founder and science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard.

                 In a statement to The Associated Press, Cruise's lawyer, Bertram Fields, said Wednesday that Morton's book is "absolutely loaded with false statements" and "Mr. Morton should be ashamed of himself for telling such vicious lies about a child to hype sales of his book."

                 The church has responded with a 15-page statement, calling the book "a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies" and saying Cruise "is a Scientology parishioner and holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy."

More than that, he has been recruiting fellow celebrities - people like Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith. ... More than that, he's been the frontman for the organization. Not just bringing people in, but seeing all the politicians, the movers and shakers in society to proselytize for his faith. In a way, he has also compromised himself as an actor by some of his behavior and some of his attacks, for example, on Brooke Shields for taking drugs for postpartum depression. That alienated a lot of his fans, especially women.

I've lost count of the number of people I've spoken to, former Scientologists who have said to me, 'I joined because I thought if it is good enough for Tom Cruise, if it is good enough for John Travolta, then it is good enough for me.'

That sent alarm bells ringing inside Scientology ... and Tom was sent in and took this course which is called a PTSSP course which is to basically anchor yourself to the faith and to treat the outside world with more suspicion because it is a self-contained cocooned world. You become more distant from the people who no longer believe in you, who no longer believe in the faith and one of those was Nicole Kidman. Having said all that, when Nicole was sitting after the break up and sobbing into her handkerchief and saying to her friend, "Why did he leave?" She had no real answer. ... She was always seen as somewhat of a problem because her father is a psychiatrist and Scientologists loathe psychiatry.

Similarly, with Katie, she used to tell her sisters that one day she would marry Tom Cruise. When she was on the set of "Dawson's Creek," she was teased mercilessly because she had this crush on Tom Cruise. When she met him ... he had her at hello. Very soon afterward, she found herself alienated from her friends. She found herself surrounded by Scientologists. She got rid of her manager. She got rid of her management.

                 Observers who interviewed her at the time used to call her deadeye Katie. The reason why that was significant is because she got her job as Joey on "Dawson's Creek" in the first place because of her incredible eyes, because of the life and sparkle in her eyes. It seemed to people who were interviewing her at the time that she changed and changed significantly.
