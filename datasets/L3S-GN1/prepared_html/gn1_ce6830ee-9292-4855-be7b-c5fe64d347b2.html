                Rice, who split off from U.S. President George W. Bush's  Mideast tour for an unannounced visit to Baghdad, said the  Iraqi parliament's approval Saturday of a U.S.-sought  benchmark law allowing low-ranking members of Saddam  Hussein's Baath party to reclaim government jobs or  pensions was a first step and showed that last year's  «surge» of American forces was paying dividends.

                Although national reconciliation «has not always moved as  fast as some of us sitting in Washington would like, it has  certainly moved and, given the legacy, history and stains  of tyranny, it has been quite remarkable,» she said.

                Three Iraqi officials said Rice told al-Maliki he must  take advantage of Bush's last year in the White House to  aggressively pursue national reconciliation, with the  return of Sunni Arabs ministers to his Cabinet as a top  priority.

                Bush has vigorously supported al-Maliki since the Iraqi  leader took office in May last year. Bush's Democratic  critics, however, have not been as supportive, with some  charging that al-Maliki lacked the leadership qualities  needed to make difficult decisions to reconcile Iraqis.

                Six Sunni Arab ministers quit al-Maliki's government in  August to protest his perceived sectarian policies. Kurds  remain in the government, but differences have emerged  between the two sides over a draft legislation to divvy up  Iraq's oil revenue and Kirkuk, the oil-rich city claimed by  the Kurds. The city's Arab and Turkomen inhabitants dispute  the Kurdish claim.

                Al-Maliki has balked at conditions set by the Sunni Arab  parliamentary bloc that pulled its ministers from his  Cabinet. He threatened to fill the vacant posts with  members of Sunni groups that rose against al-Qaida in Anbar  province and elsewhere in Iraq and joined U.S. and Iraqi  forces in the fight against the terror network.
